  abstract = {The aim was to apply a multimarker scoring approach as complementary to freshwater monitoring programmes carried out by the Water Agency Adour–Garonne. Fish (chub, barbel and trout) were collected in 11 sites in rivers in south-west France. Five biomarkers of response were measured either in muscle or brain for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and in liver for glutathione S-transferase, catalase and 7-ethoxyresorufine O-deethylase. As a result of multivariate analysis, sites were clearly discriminated mainly by 7-ethoxyresorufine O-deethylase and acetylcholinesterase activities. According to the scoring approach, a multimarker pollution index was calculated for each sampling site as the sum of the response index of the five measured biomarkers (pollution index). Sorting was established by ranging the sites from lightly to highly contaminated locations.},

  abstract = {Oxidative stress as a result of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been observed in almost all cancers, including leukaemia, where they contribute to disease development and progression. However, cancer cells also express increased levels of antioxidant proteins which detoxify ROS. This includes glutathione, the major antioxidant in human cells, which has recently been identified to have dysregulated metabolism in human leukaemia. This suggests that critical balance of intracellular ROS levels is required for cancer cell function, growth, and survival. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) transcription factor plays a dual role in cancer. Primarily, NRF2 is a transcription factor functioning to protect nonmalignant cells from malignant transformation and oxidative stress through transcriptional activation of detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. However, once malignant transformation has occurred within a cell, NRF2 functions to protect the tumour from oxidative stress and chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, inhibition of the NRF2 oxidative stress pathway in leukaemia cells renders them more sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Our improved understanding of NRF2 biology in human leukaemia may permit mechanisms by which we could potentially improve future cancer therapies. This review highlights the mechanisms by which leukaemic cells exploit the NRF2/ROS response to promote their growth and survival.},

We have successfully applied this approach with redbreast sunfish (Lepomis auritus) in freshwater systems receiving inputs of complex contaminant mixtures containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hydrocarbons, heavy metals and chlorine. Indicators such as mixed-function oxidase (MFO) enzymes and DNA damage have provided direct evidence of toxicant exposure, while condition indices and indicators related to lipid biochemistry and histopathology have reflected impaired lipid metabolism, immune and reproductive system dysfunction, and reduced growth potential. At higher levels of organization, stress-mediated effects have included changes in the richness and biotic integrity of fish communities.},

This approach has been used to evaluate the general health status offish populations in a wide range of reservoir types in the Tennessee River basin (North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky), in Hartwell Reservoir (Georgia, South Carolina) that is contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls, and in the Pigeon River (Tennessee, North Carolina) that receives effluents from a bleached kraft mill. The ability of the HAI to accurately characterize the health offish in these systems was evaluated by comparing this index to other types of fish health measures (contaminant, bioindicator, and reproductive analysis) made at the same time as the HAI. In all cases, the HAI demonstrated the same pattern offish health status between sites as did each of the other more sophisticated health assessment methods.

This estuary has been subjected for a long time to large amounts of sewage discharges and industrial effluents. Since November 2002, no waste outlets have been discharged in this site due to their connection to a wastewater purification plant. Firstly, we have compared metal tolerance of the annelid polychaete (Nereis diversicolor) originating from Oued Souss and a relatively clean site (Oualidia, Morocco). Secondly, we have evaluated with a multi-marker approach (acetylcholinesterase [AChE], glutathione-S-transferases [GSTs], catalase, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARs]) responses of worms to the pollution gradient. Results have shown that worms from Oued Souss have acquired tolerance to copper and zinc due to a long-term sub-lethal metal exposure and this metal tolerance was maintained in spite of the end of wastewater discharges in this site. Higher catalase, GSTs and TBARs values have been observed in worms from Oued Souss sampled before implantation of wastewater treatment. The multi-marker approach confirms that these worms have been submitted to various contaminants. In contrast, high inhibition in AChE activities measured in worms from Oued Souss could be explained by the continuous agricultural influence of nearest areas. The level of contamination was probably maintained since biomarker values were generally higher in worms from Oued Souss when compared to Oualidia.},

  abstract = {Glucose is the main energy substrate for the brain. There is now extensive evidence indicating that the metabolic profile of neural cells with regard to glucose utilization and glycolysis rate is not homogenous, with a marked propensity for glycolytic glucose processing in astrocytes compared to neurons. Methylglyoxal, a highly reactive dicarbonyl compound, is inevitably formed as a by-product of glycolysis. Methylglyoxal is a major cell-permeant precursor of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are associated with several pathologies including diabetes, aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In normal situations, cells are protected against methylglyoxal toxicity by different mechanisms and in particular the glyoxalase system, which represents the most important pathway for the detoxification of methylglyoxal. While the neurotoxic effects of methylglyoxal and AGEs are well characterized, our understanding the glyoxalase system in the brain is more scattered. Considering the high energy requirements (i.e., glucose) of the brain, one should expect that the cerebral glyoxalase system is adequately fitted to handle methylglyoxal toxicity. This review focuses on our actual knowledge on the cellular aspects of the glyoxalase system in brain cells, in particular with regard to its activity in astrocytes and neurons. A main emerging concept is that these two neural cell types have different and energetically adapted glyoxalase defense mechanisms which may serve as protective mechanism against methylglyoxal-induced cellular damage.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that future warming will exacerbate the effect of local stressors such as toxicants. In this study the individual and combined effects of warming (+4°C above ambient) and a toxicant (the antifouling substance copper pyrithione) on natural intact shallow-water sediment were studied in an outdoor flow-through facility. Functional (oxygen and inorganic nutrient fluxes in light and dark, bacterial production) and structural (biomass and composition of microphytobenthos and meiofauna) variables were measured. Warming was found to modify the toxicant response antagonistically, i.e. warming removed the negative effect of the toxicant exposure. This antagonism was found for functions depending on light (gross primary production, 24 h net oxygen fluxes, oxygen and silica fluxes). Most functional variables were, however, affected by warming alone, while structural variables were affected by the toxicant alone. At the end of the experiment, the system had 2 types of microalgal communities, a typical benthic algal mat and a floating periphytic mat. Both the benthic and floating microalgal mats were significantly affected by the toxicant alone, but in opposite directions. The biomass of the benthic algal mat was significantly higher under toxicant exposure, whereas the biomass of the floating periphytic mat was lower. Our results suggest that the effects of toxicants in aquatic environments may be reduced (rather than amplified) by warming. We also show that autotrophic communities can respond differently within the same ecosystem and that habitat may determine the mode of response to warming-toxicant exposures in aquatic environments.},

In short-term contaminations, the concentrations X of the non-essential metals cadmium and lead in the organisms depend mainly on their environmental level Y according to the power function Y = aXb. For copper - an essential metal - this equation is also suitable to describe the bioaccumulation in some species (Nereis diversicolor O.F. Müller, Scrobicularia plana (da Costa), Gammarus zaddachi Sexton) for a large range of experimental overloads. As for the mussel Mytilus edulis L., this equation is accurate for medium or high overloads only. All the species are able to control the level of the essential zinc in their tissues but for both copper and zinc the best regulators are the more highly evolved forms including decapod crustaceans and fish. The in situ chronic contaminations support the same conclusions. In one fish and one decapod crustacean species it has been shown that the regulation mechanisms may be functional since early life stages. When the duration of exposure to essential metals increases, the regulation mechanism is, however, disturbed by more and more low additional concentrations in sea water.},

We have collated published information on MT in three important groups of aquatic invertebrates—the molluscs, crustaceans and annelid worms, and attempted to seek explanations for some of the apparent inconsistencies present in the dataset. MTs can be induced by the essential metals Cu and Zn and the non-essential metals Cd, Ag and Hg in both vertebrates and invertebrates, but their induction is variable. Such variation is intraspecific and interspecific, and is down to a variety of reasons environmental and physiological explored here. Against this background of variability MTs do appear to play roles both in the routine metabolic handling of essential Cu and Zn, but also in the detoxification of excess amounts intracellularly of these metals and of non-essential Cd, Ag and Hg. Different isoforms of MT probably play different physiological roles, and the dependence on MT in detoxification processes varies environmentally and between zoological groups. MTs can be used as biomarkers if used wisely in well-designed environmental monitoring programmes.},

This is the first study investigating the environmental occurrence and potential hazard of organic UV stabilizers and UV filters in the North and Baltic Sea surface sediments, including the connecting Skagerrak and Kattegat straits. In total, nineteen substances were identified over the entire study area, including the rarely studied compounds ethylhexyl triazone (EHT) and bisoctrizole (UV-360). Octocrylene (OC) was the predominant compound in this study with regard to detection frequency (79\%) and concentrations (up to 9.7\,ng/g dw). OC accounted for more than 65\% of UV stabilizer contamination in the German Bight. The triazine derivative EHT was quantified in the Rhine-Meuse-Delta and the German Bight in concentrations up to 2.0\,ng/g dw. In the Baltic Sea, benzotriazole UV stabilizers accounted for 60\% of the contamination, with UV-360 as the main substance. The estimated environmental hazard quotients indicated a negligible impact on benthic and sediment-dwelling organisms in the North and Baltic Seas. Region-specific contamination pattern and riverine influences were revealed. The results suggest that both direct and indirect sources contribute to the UV stabilizer and UV filter contamination in the study area.},

LC-50 tests on water samples from the field sites were carried out using the marine copepod Tisbe battagliai and Microtox™ assays. Biomarker responses varied among the sites. Results were analysed using novel multivariate statistical procedures. A clearer overall picture was obtained from multi-dimensional scaling plots than by examining the data for different biomarkers individually. It was possible to distinguish among contaminated and control sites, with the contaminated sites being further differentiated to reflect a pollution gradient. It was concluded that multi-dimensional scaling procedures are a valuable additional tool for improving the analysis and interpretation of complex suites of biomarker data.},

  abstract = {Wildlife managers are challenged to manage spatially structured populations efficiently and effectively, therefore dispersal and gene flow are vital to understand and manage, particularly for a harvested species. We used a genetic approach to describe the metapopulation structure of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) in Idaho to assess past patterns of population distribution and influences of harvest. We used elk tissue and DNA samples (n = 216) to examine genetic dissimilarity between 7 regions and 9 elk management zones throughout Idaho using microsatellite loci (n = 11). Using 5 approaches, including pairwise FST-values, assignment tests, and a Bayesian model-based clustering of genotypes, we examined the distribution of genetic variation. The distribution of genetic variation between elk populations indicated low levels of genetic differentiation among regions (expected heterozygosity [HE] = 0.55–0.61, overall FST=0.011) and elk management zones (HE = 0.54–0.60, overall FST= 0.017). Assignment tests and migration rates indicated directional gene flow between elk populations. A patchy metapopulation best describes the distribution of genetic variation among Idaho elk populations because likely enough individual interchange occurs between geographically separated populations. The elk populations we sampled could be part of a geographically larger patchy metapopulation potentially stretching from Yellowstone National Park through Idaho into western Canada. Because of historical translocations of elk from Yellowstone National Park, insufficient time may have passed to detect differences in genetic variation. Subtle differences in the distribution of genetic variation were observed in 2 of the 9 elk management zones within 2 different regions of the state. Our findings indicate management of Idaho elk populations and dispersal are maintaining sufficient gene flow. Metapopulation structure of a harvested species based on the distribution of genetic variation is an indicator of potential genetic consequences of harvesting and sustainable harvest levels.},

  abstract = {Heavy metals are an important class of environmental hazards, and as the use of heavy metals in industry continues to increase, larger segments of the biota, including human beings, will be exposed to increasing levels of these toxicants. As many heavy metals are mutagenic and clastogenic, they cause teratogenic and/or carcinogenic effects. Studies with microbes and representatives of the aquatic biota have shown that the toxicity of heavy metals is mediated by the physicochemical characteristics of natural environments. A few studies have also indicated that such abiotic factors (e.g., pH, chelating agents, inorganic anionic and cationic composition) mediate the mutagenicity and clastogenicity of heavy metals. These studies indicate that the physicochemical characteristics of natural environments may also potentiate or attenuate the mutagenicity and clastogenicity of heavy metals to the indigenous biota. Furthermore, studies with laboratory animals have shown that the acute and chronic toxicity, including the teratogenicity and carcinogenicity, of heavy metals is mediated by physicochemical factors. A similar dependence of the mutagenicity and clastogenicity of heavy metals by the physicochemical characteristics unique to specific body fluids and tissues may explain the association of specific heavy metal-induced tumors with specific tissues. There is an apparent need to develop genotoxicity tests that incorporate into their procedures the mediating influence of physicochemical factors (pH, for example), as the use of only standardized procedures may hinder the detection of heavy metal, as well as of organic, genotoxins whose mutagenicity or clastogenicity is altered by conditions other than those used in the standardized assay, thereby producing false negative results.},

This review first provides a brief overview of the fundamental approaches for mixture toxicity assessment, which is then followed by a critical review on the empirical evidence that is currently at hand on the ecotoxicology of pharmaceutical mixtures. It is concluded that, while the classical concepts of concentration addition and independent action (response addition) provide a robust scientific footing, several knowledge gaps remain. This includes, in particular, the need for more and better empirical data on the effects of pharmaceutical mixtures on soil organisms as well as marine flora and fauna, and exploring the quantitative consequences of toxicokinetic, toxicodynamic and ecological interactions. Increased focus should be put on investigating the ecotoxicology of pharmaceutical mixtures in environmentally realistic settings.},

  abstract = {Background Despite the growing awareness of the necessity of a sustainable development, the global economy continues to depend largely on the consumption of non-renewable energy resources. One such energy resource is fossil oil extracted from the seabed at offshore oil platforms. This type of oil production causes continuous environmental pollution from drilling waste, discharge of large amounts of produced water, and accidental spills. Methods and principal findings Samples from natural populations of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in two North Sea areas with extensive oil production were investigated. Exposure to and uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were demonstrated, and biomarker analyses revealed adverse biological effects, including induction of biotransformation enzymes, oxidative stress, altered fatty acid composition, and genotoxicity. Genotoxicity was reflected by a hepatic DNA adduct pattern typical for exposure to a mixture of PAHs. Control material was collected from a North Sea area without oil production and from remote Icelandic waters. The difference between the two control areas indicates significant background pollution in the North Sea. Conclusion It is most remarkable to obtain biomarker responses in natural fish populations in the open sea that are similar to the biomarker responses in fish from highly polluted areas close to a point source. Risk assessment of various threats to the marine fish populations in the North Sea, such as overfishing, global warming, and eutrophication, should also take into account the ecologically relevant impact of offshore oil production.},

The cholinergic system was evaluated using the acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE). Exposure to the mixture resulted in low dose level additive effects on the investigated biomarkers.

  abstract = {Identification of contamination in estuarine ecosystems that are impacted by anthropogenic pressures, such as the Seine estuary, is difficult to determine without considering the role environmental variation plays on the end points selected. Currently, there is interest in identifying methods in which the influence of confounding factors can be described and accounted for. In this context, the aim of this study was to define a baseline assessment criteria (BAC) for enzymatic biomarkers in ragworms (Hediste diversicolor) collected in a reference site (Authie). The model took into consideration the weight, temperature and salinity of the site. Values collected in the Seine estuary were analyzed with the model to determine if differences between the sites could potentially be due to contamination or were explained by environmental variation. In general, biomarker responses from the Seine estuary fell within the range of BAC, suggesting that environmental variation could explain some of the results.},

  abstract = {The Kerguelen Islands (49°26′S, 69°50′E) represent a unique environment due to their geographical isolation, which protects them from anthropogenic pollution. The ability of the endemic mussel, part of the Mytilus complex, to cope with moderate heat stress was explored using omic tools. Transcripts involved in six major metabolic functions were selected and the qRT-PCR data indicated mainly changes in aerobic and anaerobic energy metabolism and stress response. Proteomic comparisons revealed a typical stress response pattern with cytoskeleton modifications and elements suggesting increased energy metabolism. Results also suggest conservation of protein homeostasis by the long-lasting presence of HSP while a general decrease in transcription is observed. The overall findings are consistent with an adaptive response to moderate stresses in mussels in good physiological condition, i.e. living in a low-impact site, and with the literature concerning this model species. Therefore, local blue mussels could be advantageously integrated into biomonitoring strategies, especially in the context of Global Change. In environmental science, the variability of biological responses in natural or laboratory populations is a well known and documented phenomenon. However, while an extensive literature aims to explain and understand the origin of variability, few try to use it as a demonstration of the population's response facing a stress. We propose here a theoretical framework that explores various patterns of variability both within and among populations, and seeks methods useful in bioevaluation methodologies. We also introduce the concept of “ecotoxicological niche” to characterize the ability of a population to endure contamination. In aquatic ecosystems several stressors may act together and affect the life traits of organisms. Pesticide runoffs are usually associated with high inputs of organic matter and depletion of oxygen in aquatic systems. This study aimed at combining anthropogenic stress (chemicals) and natural stress (food availability) and evaluates their joint effect to the life traits of Daphnia magna. The neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid and the heavy metal nickel chloride were used and a 21 d chronic test was carried out to obtain reproduction and growth data. The conceptual model Independent action, usually used for assessing response patterns in chemical mixtures, was used for data interpretation. Results showed an increase in the reproduction and growth pattern of D. magna as food levels increased. Both chemicals significantly impaired the reproduction as well as the somatic growth of the organism while the same happened with food concentrations lower than 3×105 cells/mL. It was also observed that food availability did not change the toxicity of imidacloprid and nickel chloride when food levels were higher than 3×105 cells/mL. When combined with low food levels, imidacloprid showed a slight increase in toxicity, showing that daphnids become more sensitive with reduced food availability, however in a non-significant way. However, toxicity of nickel appeared to be independent of the food level. Both chemicals induced mortality to the organisms exposed in the absence of food only at the end of the test.},

  abstract = {A battery of biomarkers is often used to evaluate the effects of exposure to chemical contaminants and detect responses to environmental stress. Unfortunately, field application of biomarkers is subject to various constraints (e.g., the availability of living material) that can limit data acquisition and prevent the use of multivariate methods during statistical analysis. In these circumstances, a simple method is needed to summarize biomarker responses and simplify their interpretation in biomonitoring programs. The present study used star plots to display results for the panel of biomarkers used for each station and survey. Integrated biomarker response (IBR) was then computed as the star plot area. Star plots using IBR values instead of biomarker data make it possible to visualize between-site and/or between-survey differences for comparison with exposure conditions. This approach was applied to sites in the Baltic Sea and the Seine Estuary, English Channel. In both cases, IBR values were visually compared to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) or polychlorobiphenyls (PCB) levels measured in mussel or fish tissues. The IBR, as an indicator of environmental stress, appears to be a useful tool for scientists and managers in assessing ecological risk.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of chemical bioavailability and onset of biological alterations is fundamental to assess the hazard of environmental pollutants, particularly when associated to sediments which need to be removed. In the present work, five sediment samples were collected from the Venice Lagoon and data from sediment chemistry were integrated with those of bioaccumulation of chemicals in European eel (Anguilla anguilla) exposed under laboratory conditions, responses of a wide battery of biomarkers, and standardized ecotoxicological bioassays. The overall results were elaborated within a recently developed, software-assisted weight of evidence (WOE) model which provides synthetic indices for each of considered line of evidence (LOE), before a general evaluation of sediment hazard. Levels of chemicals in sediments were not particularly elevated when compared to sediment quality guidelines of Venice Protocol. On the other hand, bioavailability was evident in some samples for Cd, Cu, Zn and, especially, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The ecotoxicological approach provided further evidence on the biological and potentially harmful effects due to released contaminants, and oxidative-mediated responses appeared of primary importance in modulating sublethal responses and the onset of cellular alterations. Biomarkers variations were sensitive, and more evident variations included significant changes of cytochrome P450 biotransformation pathway, antioxidant responses, onset of oxidative damages, lysosomal membrane stability and genotoxic effects. The results obtained from the battery of bioassays indicated that responses measured at organism level were in general accordance but less marked compared to the onset of sublethal changes measured through biomarkers. Overall this study revealed differences when comparing evaluations obtained from different LOEs, confirming the importance of considering synergistic effects between chemicals in complex mixtures. Compared to a qualitative pass–fail approach toward normative values, the proposed WOE model allowed a quantitative characterization of sediment hazard and a better discrimination of on the basis of various types of chemical and biological data.},

Far too often the subtle nuances that distinguish proper randomization from flawed randomization are completely ignored in trial reports that state only that randomization was used, with no additional information. Experience has shown that in many cases, the type of randomization that was used was flawed. It is only a matter of time before medical journals and regulatory agencies come to realize that we can no longer rely on (or publish) flawed trials, and that flawed randomization in and of itself disqualifies a trial from being robust or high quality, even if that trial is of high quality otherwise. This book will help to clarify the role randomization plays in ensuring internal validity, and in drawing valid inferences from the data. The various chapters cover a variety of randomization methods, and are not limited to the most common (and most flawed) ones. Readers will come away with a profound understanding of what constitutes a valid randomization procedure, so that they can distinguish the valid from the flawed among not only existing methods but can also methods yet to be developed."--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {The adaptive response characterized by a biphasic curve is known as hormesis. In a hormesis framework, exposure to low doses leads to protective and beneficial responses while exposures to high doses are damaging and detrimental. Comparative physiologists have studied hormesis for over a century, but our understanding of hormesis is fragmented due to rifts in consensus and taxonomic-specific terminology. Hormesis has been and is currently known by multiple names; preconditioning, conditioning, pretreatment, cross tolerance, adaptive homeostasis, and rapid stress hardening (mostly low temperature: rapid cold hardening). These are the most common names used to describe adaptive stress responses in animals. These responses are mechanistically similar, while having stress-specific responses, but they all can fall under the umbrella of hormesis. Here we review how hormesis studies have revealed animal performance benefits in response to changes in oxygen, temperature, ionizing radiation, heavy metals, pesticides, dehydration, gravity, and crowding. And how almost universally, hormetic responses are characterized by increases in performance that include either increases in reproduction, longevity, or both. And while the field can benefit from additional mechanistic work, we know that many of these responses are rooted in increases of antioxidants and oxidative stress protective mechanisms; including heat shock proteins. There is a clear, yet not fully elucidated, overlap between hormesis and the preparation for oxidative stress theory; which predicts part of the responses associated with hormesis. We discuss this, and the need for additional work into animal hormetic effects particularly focusing on the cost of hormesis.},

The degree of exposure in the field was assessed by considering both total concentrations in superficial sediment and the quantities of metals which may be released in vitro at different pH levels. Among the three contaminated sites, release of the three metals was not detectable in Boulogne harbor, in correlation with limited enhancement of the metal concentrations in the common ragworms from this site. Even at those sites where zinc could be released in vitro from the sediment, zinc concentrations were not enhanced in common ragworms, in agreement with previous findings indicating that the body content of this metal is regulated in H. diversicolor. At all the studied sites, bioaccumulated zinc was mainly in cytosolic form. The distribution of cadmium and copper varied according to the origin of the common ragworms, the insoluble fraction increasing with the degree of contamination (cadmium in the Restronguet Creek, copper in the Seine estuary, and even more in Restronguet Creek). In the cytosolic fraction, metals were partly linked to cytosolic heat-stable thiolic compounds (CHSTC) with molecular masses (5–6 kDa and about 12 kDa) consistent with metallothionein-like proteins (MTLP). Metal-binding to MTLP varied with the degree of contamination and with the metal studied. In contrast to many invertebrates, the presence of metal-binding CHSTC (MM about 2 kDa) other than MTLP seems to be a peculiar feature of H. diversicolor.},

In this study, two major reef-building species Acropora muricata and Pocillopora damicornis were exposed in situ to ambient and moderate nickel concentrations on a short-term period (1h) using benthic chamber experiments. Simultaneously, we tested in laboratory conditions the combined effects of a chronic exposure (8weeks) to moderate nickel concentrations and ocean warming on A. muricata. The in situ experiment highlighted that nickel enrichment, at ambient temperature, stimulated by 27 to 47\% the calcification rates of both species but not their photosynthetic performances. In contrast, an exposure to higher nickel concentration, in combination with elevated temperature simulated in aquaria, severely depressed by 30\% the growth of A. muricata.},

  abstract = {A spatial and temporal survey of six sites in the Saguenay Fjord and of one adjacent site in the St. Lawrence River estuary (Quebec, Canada) was undertaken to study the possible effects of anthropogenic contaminant input on soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) populations. Bivalve sampling sites were selected because they reflected a range of areas representative of either no known (or apparent) pollution sources or of areas potentially influenced by different gradients and types of contamination sources. The most upstream site selected in the Saguenay Fjord, nearest to a highly populated and industrialized sector, and the most downstream site, near its mouth with the St. Lawrence River estuary, spanned a distance of some 70 km and encompassed the entire intertidal area suitable for Mya arenaria habitat. To measure effects in collected animals, we used a comprehensive battery of biomarkers composed of metallothionein-like proteins (MT), 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity (EROD), DNA damage (DD), lipid peroxidation (LPO), vitellinlike proteins (Vn), phagocytosis (PHAG), nonspecific esterase (NspE) activity, and condition factor (weight-to-length ratio of clams). Vn, PHAG, DD, and NspE biomarkers were assayed in hemolymph (or hemocytes), whereas others (MT, EROD, LPO) were determined in the digestive gland. Whole-tissue metal content was also quantified in clams collected in the spatial survey. The spatial survey conducted in June 1997 showed significant effects at all sites, and principal component analysis indicated in addition that the more important responses were linked to the MT, LPO, and NspE biomarkers. Clams collected from sites closest to the upstream reaches of the fjord generally displayed higher levels of tissue metals (cadmium, manganese), as well as greater responses of NspE activity, MT, LPO, and PHAG. Animals collected from sites influenced by municipal wastewaters had higher levels of Vn, suggesting the presence of environmental estrogens. The results of the temporal survey (six monthly samplings of clams at three sites from May through October, 1997) showed that the bivalve reproductive cycle (vitellogenesis and spawning) can modulate the expression of several biomarkers. Vn levels, for example, were positively correlated with DD and EROD and negatively correlated with MT, suggesting that reproduction can influence the susceptibility of clams to some contaminants. Discrimination analysis over the 6 months of sampling revealed that the mean value of the discriminant function changed significantly over time, suggesting important changes in the relative contribution of each biomarker. In short, this study has provided evidence that clam populations in the Saguenay Fjord are impacted by multiple sources of contamination whose effects can be modulated by reproduction. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Soil bulk density Db is the ratio of the mass to the bulk or macroscopic volume of soil particles plus pore spaces in a sample. In most agricultural soils work, bulk density is expressed in grams per cubic centimeter. In these units volume weight is equal, and bulk specific gravity is nearly equal, numerically, to bulk density. The term bulk density is preferred over the terms volume weight, bulk specific gravity or apparent specific gravity. It is often desired to make other measurements on the same samples taken for bulk density. Water content determinations, like bulk density, do not require that the soil be kept undisturbed during transport to the laboratory and drying. Calculate bulk density from the oven-dry mass of the excavated sample and the volume of the test excavation. The bulk density of clods, or coarse peds, can be calculated from their mass and volume.},

  abstract = {Mussels are widely used in toxicological experimentation; however, experimental setups are not standardized yet. Although there is evidence of changes in biomarker values during food digestion and depending on the mussel nutritive status, the mode of feeding differs among toxicological experiments. Typically, mussels are fed with different diets in different long-term experiments, while fasting is the most common approach for short-term studies. Consequently, comparisons among experiments and reliable interpretations of biomarker results are often unfeasible. The present investigation aimed at determining the influence of fasting (against feeding with Isochrysis galbana) on biomarkers and their responsiveness in mussels exposed for 96 h to the water accommodated fraction (WAF) of a heavy fuel oil (0\%, 6.25\%, 12.5\% and 25\% WAF in sea water). PAH tissue levels in digestive gland and a battery of biomarkers were compared. WAF exposure led to decrease of cytochrome-C-oxidase activity, modulated glutathione-S-transferase activity, augmented lipid peroxidation, inhibited acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) activity, and led to lysosomal enlargement (VvLYS and S/VLYS) and membrane destabilisation, lipofuscin accumulation, and histopathological alterations (VvBAS, MLR/MET and CTD ratio) in the digestive gland epithelium; and were integrated as IBR/n (biological response index). Overall, no significant changes were recorded in AChE activity, S/VLYS and CTD ratio in any experimental treatment, while all the other biomarkers showed significant changes depending on the fasting/feeding condition, the exposure to WAF and/or their interaction. As a result, the integrated biomarker index IBR/n was higher at increasing WAF exposure levels both in fasted and fed mussels albeit the response was more marked in the latter. The response profiles were qualitatively similar between fasted and fed mussels but quantitatively more pronounced in fed mussels, especially upon exposure to the highest concentration (25\% WAF). Therefore, it is highly recommended that mussels are also supplied with food during short-term, like during long-term toxicological experiments. This practice would avoid the interference of fasting with biological responses elicited by the tested chemicals and allow for reliable comparison with data obtained in long-term experiments and monitoring programmes.},

  abstract = {In marine pollution monitoring, the biomarkers recorded in sentinel organisms are influenced by natural confounding factors that may jeopardise their interpretation. Among these confounding factors, little is known about the influence of sex along the annual reproductive cycle. The present investigation aims at contributing to understand how sex and sex-related differences in gamete development progression impinge on biomarker baseline values and on biomarker responsiveness to pollution in sentinel mussels. Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were collected from a relatively clean locality and from a chronically polluted site in the Basque Coast (Bay of Biscay) in January, April, August and November. Sex and gametogenesis stages were determined for each mussel. Tissue concentration of metals and PAHs was analysed. A battery of biomarkers was investigated: cytochrome c oxidase, pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase enzyme activities; levels of protein carbonyls, malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; lysosomal enlargement and membrane stability; intracellular neutral lipid accumulation; cell type composition and thinning of the digestive gland epithelium; and survival-in-air. Sex- and reproductive stage-related differences were found in bioaccumulation and in the values and responsiveness of most of the biomarkers. However, the patterns of sex-related differences were not consistent across all biomarkers. The differences in the biomarker responses between females and males also depended on the season, reflecting the progression of the gametogenesis cycle. Thus, selecting mussels of one specific sex does not seem to be a crucial requisite to carry out biomarker-based monitoring; yet, it is highly recommended to identify sex condition and gamete developmental stage of each mussel to test for the potentially confounding effects of sex, reproductive status and sex-related variability along the reproductive cycle.},

The design of the contamination procedure took into account the results assessing the influence of some natural factors potentially able to influence burrowing (artificial vs. natural sediment, lighting, size of the shell for bivalves). Animals were exposed for 4 d to concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 μ g Cu l− 1. At the end of exposure, the burrowing kinetics in clean sediment were determined after 1 and 2 d, then the animals were frozen until acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity determination. Even at the lowest tested concentrations, copper caused hypoactivity in organisms belonging to both species studied. Behavioral impairments were not related to AChE activity inhibition. Metabolical or physiological disturbances could be the cause of these impairments. Concentrations affecting burrowing behavior were below those responsible for lethality in these species.},

  abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems are under severe pressure. Human activities introduce an array of pressures that impact ecosystems and their components. In this study we focus on the aquatic domains of fresh, coastal and marine waters, including rivers, lakes and riparian habitats to transitional, coastal as well as shelf and oceanic habitats. In an environmental risk assessment approach, we identified impact chains that link 45 human activities through 31 pressures to 82 ecosystem components. In this linkage framework {$>$}22,000 activity-pressure-ecosystem component interactions were found across seven European case studies. We identified the environmental impact risk posed by each impact chain by first categorically weighting the interactions according to five criteria: spatial extent, dispersal potential, frequency of interaction, persistence of pressure and severity of the interaction, where extent, dispersal, frequency and persistence account for the exposure to risk (spatial and temporal), and the severity accounts for the consequence of the risk. After assigning a numerical score to each risk criterion, we came up with an overall environmental impact risk score for each impact chain. This risk score was analysed in terms of (1) the activities and pressures that introduce the greatest risk to European aquatic domains, and (2) the aquatic ecosystem components and realms that are at greatest risk from human activities. Activities related to energy production were relevant across the aquatic domains. Fishing was highly relevant in marine and environmental engineering in fresh waters. Chemical and physical pressures introduced the greatest risk to the aquatic realms. Ecosystem components that can be seen as ecotones between different ecosystems had high impact risk. We show how this information can be used in informing management on trade-offs in freshwater, coastal and marine resource use and aid decision-making.},

  abstract = {The present work aimed to assess the effects of two widespread metallic pollutants, copper and silver, along with environmentally-realistic temperature increases, on embryo-larval development of the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. First, mussel embryos upon fertilization were exposed for 48~h to increasing concentrations of Cu (0.5–500~μg/L) and Ag (0.1–100~μg/L) at different temperatures (18, 20, 22 or 24~°C) in order to characterize toxicity of each toxicant at the different tested temperatures. Increasing concentrations of a Cu-Ag mixture were then tested in order to assess the mixture effect at different temperatures (18, 20 or 22~°C). Embryotoxicity was measured after 48~h of exposure (D-larvae stage) considering both the percentage of abnormalities and developmental arrest in D-larvae. The results suggest that the optimum temperature for mussel larvae development is 18~°C (12.65±~1.6\% malformations) and beyond 20~°C a steep increase of abnormal larvae was observed up to 100\% at 24~°C. Ag was more toxic than Cu with a 50\% effective concentration (EC50) at 18~°C of 6.58~μg/L and 17.6~μg/L, respectively. Temperature increased the toxicity of both metals as proved with the EC50 at 20~°C at 3.86~μg/L and 16.28~μg/L for Ag and Cu respectively. Toxic unit calculation suggests additive effects of Cu and Ag in mixture at 18 and 20~°C. These results highlight a possible impairment of M.~galloprovincialis reproduction in the Mediterranean Sea in relation to increase of both pollutants and water temperature due to global warming.},

  abstract = {Heavy metal pollution of sediments is a growing concern in most parts of the world, and numerous studies focussed on identifying contaminated sediments by using a range of digestion methods and pollution indices to estimate sediment contamination have been described in the literature. The current work provides a critical review of the more commonly used sediment digestion methods and identifies that weak acid digestion is more likely to provide guidance on elements that are likely to be bioavailable than other traditional methods of digestion. This work also reviews common pollution indices and identifies the Nemerow Pollution Index as the most appropriate method for establishing overall sediment quality. Consequently, a modified Pollution Index that can lead to a more reliable understanding of whole sediment quality is proposed. This modified pollution index is then tested against a number of existing studies and demonstrated to give a reliable and rapid estimate of sediment contamination and quality.},

The technique applied in the present study is commonly used, but several potential problems may limit its validity: (i) the stability of the metal–SH links during heating and the possibility of metal exchanges between MTs and others compounds; (ii) the presence of heat-stable thiol compounds with high molecular weight or very low molecular weight, which may subsist in the supernatant and interfere during global analysis of MTs; (iii) the subsistence of metals not bound to MT in the supernatant after heating; and (iv) the impact of reducing agents such as mercaptoethanol on the metal-binding ligands. Our investigations were conducted mainly on oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and polychaetes (Hediste/Nereis diversicolor) sampled, respectively, in two French metal-rich sites, the Gironde estuary and Boulogne harbour. This study, which allowed us to clarify most of the potential problems noted above, indicates the importance of dealing with methodological difficulties.},

The BAI represents a modification of the “health assessment index” since it includes solely validated biomarkers reflecting toxically induced alterations at different levels of biological organisation in order to quantify the effects of environmental pollution. The concept of the BAI is based on the observation of progressive deleterious effects from early responses to late effects. Specific “key events” were detected, representing progressive stages of functional deterioration. The biomarkers selected from a whole battery of cellular markers for the BAI calculation reflect deleterious effects of various classes of contaminants such as heavy metals, organochlorines, pesticides, PAHs, and therefore reflect general toxicity in an integrative manner. Selected biomarkers were: lysosomal perturbations (reduced membrane stability), storage disorders (lipid accumulation) as early markers for toxic effects of liver cells, and the size of macrophage aggregates and their acid phosphatase activity. The latter two markers are indicative for the modulation of non-specific immune response which represents longer time scale responses after chronic exposure.},

The Bioeffect Assessment Index (BAI) and the Integrated Biomarker Index (IBR) combine different biomarkers to single values, which can be used to describe the toxically-induced stress level of populations in different areas. Both indices determined here produced essentially similar results, which in most cases agreed with the known contamination levels in the different study areas.

The use of indices provides comprehensive information about biological effects of pollution in marine organisms and may therefore serve as a useful tool for environmental management by ranking the pollution status of marine coastal areas.},

  abstract = {Nanopollutants such as nZnO gain importance as contaminants of emerging concern due to their high production volume and potential toxicity. Coastal sediments serve as sinks for nanoparticles but the impacts and the toxicity mechanisms of nZnO in sediment-dwelling organisms are not well understood. We used metabolomics to assess the effects of nZnO-contaminated sediments on a benthic ecosystem engineer, an infaunal polychaete Arenicola marina. The worms were exposed to unpolluted (control) sediment or to the sediment spiked with 100 or 1000 μg Zn kg−1 of nZnO. Oxidative lesions (lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls) were measured in the body wall as traditional biomarkers of nanopollutant toxicity. Metabolite profiles (including amino acids, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and urea cycle intermediates) were determined in the body wall and the coelomic fluid. Exposure to nZnO altered metabolism of the lugworms via suppression of the metabolism of gluconeogenic and aromatic amino acids, and altered the TCA cycle likely via suppression of fumarase activity. These metabolic changes may negatively affect carbohydrate metabolism and energy storage, and impair hormonal signaling in the worms. The total pool of free amino acids was depleted in nZnO exposures with potentially negative consequences for osmoregulation and protein synthesis. Exposure to nZnO led to accumulation of the lipid peroxidation products demonstrating high susceptibility of the cellular membranes to nZnO-induced oxidative stress. The nZnO-induced shifts in the metabolite profiles were more pronounced in the coelomic fluid than the body wall. This finding emphasizes the important metabolic role of the coelomic fluid as well as its suitability for assessing the toxic impacts of nZnO and other metabolic disruptors. The metabolic disruptions caused by environmentally relevant concentrations of nZnO can have negative effects on the organisms' fitness impairing growth and reproduction of the populations of marine bioturbators like the lugworms in nanoparticle-polluted sediments.},

The contribution of some jaw metals to the total body burden varies according to body size: in small worms the jaw zinc accounts for over 40\% of the total but in large worms it accounts for 30\% or less; jaw manganese contributes over 50\% of the total in small worms, dropping to about 20\% with increasing size. For silver, cadmium, copper, iron and lead the jaws generally contribute less than 1\% to the total body burden.},

  abstract = {Evidence of long-term metal pollution in the Fal Estuary is provided by analyses of Cu in oyster (Ostrea edulis) communities extending over more than 120 yr and by analyses of Cu and Zn in sediments dating back to 1921. Indications are that levels of Cu pollution from mining have declined very slowly but that Zn pollution has not. In Restronguet Creek, the most heavily polluted area, metal levels in waters and sediments are elevated by orders of magnitude. The invertebrate fauna of the creek is limited, but far richer than might be predicted from laboratory toxicity data. The cockleCerastoderma edule exemplifies organisms that are excluded from the creek owing to the toxicity of dissolved Cu, whereasOstrea edulis, by virtue of its innate tolerance to Cu and Zn, grown in the Iower reaches. On the other hand, the population of the ragwornNereis diversicolor, which penetrates into the most heavily polluted areas, is demonstrably far more tolerant of Cu and Zn than population from clean areas and appears to be a tolerant strain. To a considerable degree, therefore, the distribution of species is dependent not only on the innate ability of some species to tolerate Cu and Zn, but on the capacities of other populations to develop metal resistance and thereby maintain their original range of distribution. Present-day problems in the Fal Estuary appear to stem not only from mining wastes but also from the increased usage of tributyltins in antifouling paints. In the dogwhelkNucella lapillus, the incidence of imposex (the appearance of a penis and other male characters in females) is virtually 100\% at sites along the English Channel coast of southwest England. The degree of imposex is related to the body concentration of hexane-extractable organotin, which includes both tributyltin and dibutyltin fractions. The highest degree of imposex, where the female penis approaches that of the male in size, occurs in the Fal Estuary; also, in some males the penis becomes deformed. Populations of dogwhelks have declined dramatically in this estuary, and are also characterised by the presence of relatively fewer females and by the absence of juveniles and egg capsules. Reproductive failure in females is now known to be caused by blockage of the pallial oviduct during the development of imposex.},

Estuaries and metals primarily discussed include the Mersey (Hg, methylmercury; Pb, alkyllead), the Loughor (Cr, Sn), the Severn (Ag, Cd), the Fal (As, Cu, Sn, Zn), Poole Harbour (Cd, Hg, Se, tributyltin) and Southampton Water (tributyltin). Concentrations and bioavailabilities of metals in estuarine sediments depend on many different processes. Examples include (1) mobilisation of metals to the interstitial water and their chemical speciation, (2) transformation (e.g. methylation) of metals including As, Hg, Pb and Sn (3) the control exerted by major sediment components (e.g. oxides of Fe and organics) to which metals are preferentially bound, (4) competition between sediment metals (e.g. Cu and Ag; Zn and Cd) for uptake sites in organisms, and (5) the influence of bioturbation, salinity, redox or pH on these processes. Under field conditions, identification of dominant processes can be achieved by observing the goodness of fit between metal concentrations in ubiquitous deposit-feeding species and levels in various types of sediment extract over a wide spectrum of sediment types. Factors of more local importance are often indicated by the marked deviation of some points from otherwise excellent relationships. For example, points lying above the line relating tissue Sn concentrations in the clam Scrobicularia plana to those in 1 n HCl extracts of sediments were found to reflect the accumulation of tributyltin, a more readily bioavailable form of Sn. In the same species, unexpectedly high tissue-Cu concentrations were characteristic of very anoxic in sediments and tissue And As and Pb concentrations were suppressed in sediments having high concentrations of Fe oxides. Under field conditions, examples of deleterious effects on benthic organisms that can be attributed to specific metallic pollutants are comparatively rare. Effects of tributyltins from antifouling paints on oysters and neogastropods have been documented and their toxicity has undoubtedly led to environmental degradation in many UK estuaries and coastal areas. In estuaries contaminated with metal-mining wastes, the effects of Cu and Zn on species distribution can be observed, but they are generally less obvious than would be predicted from experimental data. Effects are ameliorated by the induction of metal tolerance mechanisms in some species and in others by the appearance of tolerant strains. The induction of metal detoxification systems involving the formation of granules or metal-binding proteins leads in some species to tissue concentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than normal. For example, high concentrations of Cd and Ag have been found in some species from the Severn Estuary, although there is no unequivocal evidence that either metal has caused deleterious effects on benthic populations. On the other hand, experimental studies with Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg and Zn show that they are toxic to some species at environmentally realistic levels. Since pollutants rarely occur singly, it is likely that in many moderately contaminated estuaries metals contribute to the stress to organisms caused by substances requiring detoxification. There has been much speculation over the years concerning the biomagnification of metals with increasing trophic levels along food chains. Whilst animals having higher metal concentrations than their prey are sometimes found, the only consistent evidence of biomagnification concerns methylmercury. When estuarine birds are considered, there are relatively few instances in which deleterious effects can unequivocally be attributed to metals or their compounds. However, the Mersey bird kill was attributable to alkyllead pollution from industry. Among other organometals, methylmercury has proved toxic to birds but, so far, no evidence for the toxicity of tributyltin has been reported. However, the compound may have affected bird populations through its effects on the abundance of prey organisms, particularly estuarine molluscs. Of the inorganic forms of metals, Pb in the form of shot has caused problems in many areas and Cd, Hg and Se are suspected of causing toxic effects. There is little field evidence that birds have been affected by Ag, As, Cr, Cu or Zn individually. On the other hand, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that, additively, these metals may produce a significant effect. In part, the lack of evidence reflects the fact that relatively little research has been done. There is scope for more work on metals and organometals in estuarine birds, particularly with regard to their metabolism and their effects on juveniles and individuals subjected to stresses such as starvation.},

  abstract = {Description Hediste diversicolor is one of the commonest intertidal polychaetes in estuaries. Its body appears flattened with a prominent dorsal blood vessel. Adults may reach 6-12 cm in length and consist of between 90-120 chaetae bearing segments (chaetigers). Appendages on the head are conspicuous consisting of two antennae, and two palps, and four pairs of tentacles. The paired parapodia have dorsal and ventral chaetae and are used for crawling and swimming. The colour of Hediste diversicolor varies. Mature worms become a brighter green approaching and during spawning, otherwise specimens appear to be a reddish orange or brown. There has been considerable controversy over the name to be applied to this species and Nereis diversicolor is used by many authors.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses microsomal lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is a complex process known to occur in both plants and animals. It involves the formation and propagation of lipid radicals, the uptake of oxygen, a rearrangement of the double bonds in unsaturated lipids, and the eventual destruction of membrane lipids, producing a variety of breakdown products, including alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, and ethers. Biological membranes are often rich in unsaturated fatty acids and bathed in an oxygen-rich, metal-containing fluid. Lipid peroxidation begins with the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from an unsaturated fatty acid, resulting in the formation of a lipid radical. The formation of lipid endoperoxides in unsaturated fatty acids containing at least 3 methylene interrupted double bonds can lead to the formation of malondialdehyde as a breakdown product. Nonenzymic peroxidation of microsomal membranes also occurs and is probably mediated in part by endogenous hemoproteins and transition metals. The direct measurement of lipid hydroperoxides has an advantage over the thiobarbituric acid assay in that it permits a more accurate comparison of lipid peroxide levels in dissimilar lipid membranes.},

  abstract = {Engineered nano-sized Cu oxide particles are extensively used in diverse applications. Because aquatic environments are the ultimate “sink” for all contaminants, it is expected that nanoparticles (NP) will follow the same fate. In this study, two marine invertebrates Scrobicularia plana and Hediste diversicolor were chosen as ecotoxicological models. The aim was to evaluate behavioural (burrowing kinetics, feeding rate) and biochemical (biomarkers) responses of S. plana and H. diversicolor exposed in the laboratory to Cu (10μgL−1) added in natural seawater either in the form of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) of CuO or as dissolved Cu in 2\% HNO3. Exposure was characterized by considering (i) the physico-chemical fate of NP (ii) the fraction of labile Cu in experimental media and (iii) Cu bioaccumulation. Results showed high aggregation of CuO NPs in seawater and no additional bioavailable Cu concentrations. Behavioural impairments were observed in S. plana exposed to CuO NPs or soluble Cu whereas in H. diversicolor, only the exposure to soluble Cu led to a burrowing decrease. No obvious neurotoxicity effects were revealed since in both species, no changes in cholinesterasic activity occurred in response to both forms of Cu exposure. Biomarkers of oxidative-stress catalase and glutathione-S-transferase were enhanced in both species whereas superoxide dismutase was increased only in S. plana exposed to CuO NPs. Metallothionein-like protein was increased in bivalves exposed to both forms of Cu. Since, no detectable release of soluble Cu from CuO NPs occurred during the time of experiment, ecotoxicity effects seem to be related to CuO NPs themselves.},

Behavioral biomarkers, antioxidant defenses (catalase, glutathion S-transferase, metallothionein), and genotoxicity are the most sensitive tools to highlight the effect of soluble or nanoparticulate metal forms.

The aim of this study was to examine toxicity effects of CdS engineered nanoparticles (CdS NPs) compared to soluble Cd, on marine ragworms (Hediste diversicolor) exposed for 14d to these contaminants (10μgCdL−1) in seawater or via their food (contaminated worm tissue). In our experimental media, Dynamic Light Scattering studies showed that the majority of CdS remained in the nanoscale (1–10nm) with the exception of few aggregates (100–300nm). Labile Cd fractions released from CdS NPs were estimated by diffusive gradient in thin films, showing that about 50\% of CdS NPs remained in nanoparticulate form. Ragworms accumulated Cd in both soluble Cd and CdS NPs in waterborne exposures only. Greater significant changes of biochemical responses were observed in worms exposed to CdS NPs in seawater compared to contaminated food. Catalase and glutathione-S-transferase activities were the most sensitive biochemical biomarkers responding to both Cd treatments for waterborne exposure. Inductions of CAT were higher in diet-exposed worms to Cd as NPs vs soluble form suggesting a specific “nano” effect. Caspase activities increased in worms exposed to soluble Cd and Cd NPs for the two routes of exposure compared to controls. Defences, may be insufficient to prevent reactive oxygen species generation and the associated apoptosis. Behaviour of invertebrates inside sediment showed impairments of body movements in worms exposed to CdS NPs. This study points out oxidative processes as the main consequences of exposure to Cd based NPs in worms.},

Among them, teleost fish are known as very sensitive to anthropogenic impacts, and are often being used as sentinel species in the aquatic environment. Xenobiotic molecules can alter the physiological homeostasis of fish and trigger an oxidative stress through overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suppressing the antioxidant system (AS) activity. An overwhelming generation of ROS is usually accompanied by damage to lipids, proteins and DNA structure, which can be associated with mutations, chromosomal aberrations and carcinogenesis. In particular, more attention has been paid lately to transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation by several genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) related to AS after xenobiotic exposure in fish. Revealing these molecular mechanisms will help better understanding the processes of detoxification of xenobiotics and resistance to stress, and can also provide valuable information for estimating risk assessment of environmental pollution.},

Anthropogenic activities may change the chemical constituency of sediments and the rate, frequency, and extent of sediment transport, deposition, and resuspension. The importance of sediments as stressors will depend on site ecosystem attributes and the magnitude and preponderance of co-occurring stressors. Contaminants are usually of greater ecological consequence in human-modified, depositional environments, where other anthropogenic stressors often co-occur. Risk assessments and restoration strategies should better consider the role of chemical contamination in the context of multiple stressors. There have been numerous advances in the temporal and spatial characterization of stressor exposures and quantification of biological responses. Contaminated sediments causing biological impairment tend to be patchy, whereas more pervasive anthropogenic stressors, such as alterations to habitat and flow, physical disturbance, and nutrient addition, may drive large-scale ecosystem responses. A systematic assessment of relevant ecosystem attributes and reference conditions can assist in understanding the importance of sediments in the context of other stressors. Experimental manipulations then allow for the controlled study of dominant stressors and the establishment of causal links.

  abstract = {Coastal areas have been increasingly affected by human activities, marine pollution and climate change are among the most important pressures affecting these environments. Human-induced pressures occur in a cumulative way and generate additive, antagonistic or synergistic effects. Knowledge on synergistic effects is crucial to coastal zone management, since they may imply a change in human uses of these systems, as well as dedicated action plans in order to reduce hazards and environmental risks. In this work, we provide an overview of the available literature on synergistic effects between climate change and chemical pollution, and discuss current knowledge, methodological approaches, and research gaps and needs. Interactions between these two pressures may be climate change dominant (climate change leads to an increase in contaminant exposure or toxicity) or contaminant-dominant (chemical exposure leads to an increase in climate change susceptibility), but the mechanistic drivers of such processes are not well known. Results from a few meta-analyses studies and reviews showed that synergistic interactions tend to be more frequent compared to additive and antagonistic ones. However, most of the studies are individual-based and assess the cumulative effects of a few contaminants individually in laboratory settings together with few climate variables, particularly temperature and pH. Nevertheless, a wide diversity of contaminants have already been individually tested, spanning from metals, persistent organic pollutants and, more recently, emergent pollutants. Population and community based approaches are less frequent but have generated very interesting and more holistic perspectives. Methodological approaches are quite diverse, from laboratory studies to mesocosm and field studies, or based on statistical or modelling tools, each with their own potential and limitations. More holistic comparisons integrating several pressures and their combinations and a multitude of habitats, taxa, life-stages, among others, are needed, as well as insights from meta-analyses and systematic reviews.},

  abstract = {UVs are important ingredients in common cosmetic products (e.g., sunscreens, hairsprays, soap). After their use, they can enter the aquatic ecosystem and negatively affect non-target aquatic organisms. The aim of our study was to evaluate acute embryotoxicity of selected organic UVs 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid (PBSA), ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), octocrylene (OC), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3). The chemicals were tested both as a single substance and their mixtures. The types of mixtures were chosen as follows: the combination of OC and 4-MBC; the combination of PBSA, EHMC and BP-3 and the combination of all five UV filters. The embryotoxicity was evaluated using a modified method of the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test-OECD guideline 236 and zebrafish (Danio rerio) was selected as a suitable fish model organism. The toxic effects were studied by assessing mortality, hatching and the occurrence of malformations at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post fertilization. The obtained results indicate that especially the mixture of OC and 4-MBC presents a potential risk of embryotoxicity for zebrafish due to a significant increase in mortality, which was 41.7\% in the experimental group exposed to 10 μg/L at 96 h post fertilization. Based on our results, the most effected sub-lethal endpoints were hatching and malformation (e.g., edema of pericard, bent spine, yolk edema), but with no statistically significant effect. These results differ within groups with single UVs and with their mixtures, suggesting the interaction of these substances when they are exposed together.},

  abstract = {Within the frame of the 2nd Iberian Congress of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology (University of the Basque Country, Leioa, June 1998) a workshop was held about the use of biomarkers in marine pollution monitoring. Among others, the following biomarkers received special attention: metallothionein induction, acetylcholinesterase inhibition, cytochrome P450 system induction, imposex, lysosomal enlargement and lysosomal membrane destabilisation, and peroxisome proliferation. These biomarkers can be used to evaluate exposure to and effect of different contaminants (metals, organic xenobiotics and organometallic compounds) and they can be measured using different methodological approaches (biochemistry, cytochemistry, immunochemical methods based on the use of biotechnology). Before the application of a set of biomarkers in pollution monitoring programmes, well-defined protocols of Quality Assurance have to be established to allow adequate comparison of results. It is also necessary to include analysis of standard reference materials and to obtain detailed knowledge of basal values and seasonal variations of the biomarkers in various species, as well as to integrate the information obtained with the different biomarkers. Marine bivalve molluscs such as mussels are appropriate sentinel species for most of the biomarkers proposed except for the induction of the cytochrome P450 system, which should be measured in fish, and the degree of imposex, which is a biomarker of exposure to TBT specifically measured in certain gastropod molluscs. As a result of the workshop, a battery of biomarkers of contaminant exposure and effects are proposed that could be incorporated into programmes monitoring the quality of the coastal environment in the Iberian Peninsula. These measures would be undertaken in conjunction with chemical measures of contaminant burdens in selected sentinel species.},

  abstract = {Agriculture and urban activities are major sources of phosphorus and nitrogen to aquatic ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition further contributes as a source of N. These nonpoint inputs of nutrients are difficult to measure and regulate because they derive from activities dispersed over wide areas of land and are variable in time due to effects of weather. In aquatic ecosystems, these nutrients cause diverse problems such as toxic algal blooms, loss of oxygen, fish kills, loss of biodiversity (including species important for commerce and recreation), loss of aquatic plant beds and coral reefs, and other problems. Nutrient enrichment seriously degrades aquatic ecosystems and impairs the use of water for drinking, industry, agriculture, recreation, and other purposes. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain that (1) eutrophication is a widespread problem in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans, caused by overenrichment with P and N; (2) nonpoint pollution, a major source of P and N to surface waters of the United States, results primarily from agriculture and urban activity, including industry; (3) inputs of P and N to agriculture in the form of fertilizers exceed outputs in produce in the United States and many other nations; (4) nutrient flows to aquatic ecosystems are directly related to animal stocking densities, and under high livestock densities, manure production exceeds the needs of crops to which the manure is applied; (5) excess fertilization and manure production cause a P surplus to accumulate in soil, some of which is transported to aquatic ecosystems; and (6) excess fertilization and manure production on agricultural lands create surplus N, which is mobile in many soils and often leaches to downstream aquatic ecosystems, and which can also volatilize to the atmosphere, redepositing elsewhere and eventually reaching aquatic ecosystems. If current practices continue, nonpoint pollution of surface waters is virtually certain to increase in the future. Such an outcome is not inevitable, however, because a number of technologies, land use practices, and conservation measures are capable of decreasing the flow of nonpoint P and N into surface waters. From our review of the available scientific information, we are confident that: (1) nonpoint pollution of surface waters with P and N could be reduced by reducing surplus nutrient flows in agricultural systems and processes, reducing agricultural and urban runoff by diverse methods, and reducing N emissions from fossil fuel burning; and (2) eutrophication can be reversed by decreasing input rates of P and N to aquatic ecosystems, but rates of recovery are highly variable among water bodies. Often, the eutrophic state is persistent, and recovery is slow.},

Aquatic animals, which are mainly ectotherms, are believed to present growing CTMax from poles towards the equator while their thermal tolerance, in relation to their environmental temperature would present the opposite trend. In this work such pattern is analysed in a global scale by performing metanalysis with previous work data. Also, differences between organisms living in fresh and saltwater ecosystems and between different taxa were assessed. Finally, the effect of other stressors over the thermal tolerance is compiled and discussed. It was possible to prove that, as it has been proposed, CTMax values have an inverse relation with thermal tolerance being the tropical organisms closer to their limit than in other climates. Also, temperate organisms present, in general, the highest thermal tolerance. Marine animals from the temperate region presented lower CTMax and Thermal Safety Margin (TSM) than freshwater organisms from the same region. Such pattern was not verified on the tropical region. The two mollusc classes: Gastropoda and Bivalvia, presented the highest CTMax and TSM values. Several stress factors other than temperature analysed in previous works presented significant effect. An analysis to the possible nefarious effects of such stressors over thermal tolerance was performed.},

  abstract = {Historic and ongoing sediment contamination adversely affects estuaries, among the most productive marine ecosystems in the world. However, all estuaries are not the same, and estuarine sediments cannot be treated as either fresh or marine sediments or properly assessed without understanding both seasonal and spatial estuarine variability and processes, which are reviewed. Estuaries are physicochemically unique, primarily because of their variable salinity but also because of their strong gradients in other parameters, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, and amount and composition of particles. Salinity (overlying and interstitial) varies spatially (laterally, vertically) and temporally and is the controlling factor for partitioning of contaminants between sediments and overlying or interstitial water. Salinity also controls the distribution and types of estuarine biota. Benthic infauna are affected by interstitial salinities that can be very different than overlying salinities, resulting in large-scale seasonal species shifts in salt wedge estuaries. There are fewer estuarine species than fresh or marine species (the paradox of brackish water). Chemical, toxicological, and community-level assessment techniques for estuarine sediment are reviewed and assessed, including chemistry (grain size effects, background enrichment, bioavailability, sediment quality values, interstitial water chemistry), biological surveys, and whole sediment toxicity testing (single-species tests, potential confounding factors, community level tests, laboratory-to-field comparisons). Based on this review, there is a clear need to tailor such assessment techniques specifically for estuarine environments. For instance, bioavailability models including equilibrium partitioning may have little applicability to estuarine sediments, appropriate reference comparisons are difficult in biological surveys, and there are too few full-gradient estuarine sediment toxicity tests available. Specific recommendations are made to address these and other issues.},

  abstract = {Cancer cells adapt their metabolism to their increased needs for energy and substrates for protein, lipid and nucleic acid synthesis. Nuclear erythroid factor 2-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway is usually activated in cancers and has been suggested to promote cancer cell survival mainly by inducing a large battery of cytoprotective genes. This mini review focuses on metabolic pathways, beyond cytoprotection, which can be directly or indirectly regulated by Nrf2 in cancer cells to affect their survival. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is enhanced by Nrf2 in cancers and aids their growth. PPP has also been found to be up-regulated in non-cancer tissues and other pathways, such as de novo lipogenesis, have been found to be repressed after activation of the Nrf2 pathway. The importance of these Nrf2-regulated metabolic pathways in cancer compared with non-cancer state remains to be determined. Last but not least, the importance of context about Nrf2 and cancer is highlighted as the Nrf2 pathway may be activated in cancers but its pharmacological activators are useful in chemoprevention.},

Such a function would output a low value if the profiles are strongly correlated—either negatively or positively—and vice versa. One popular distance function is the absolute correlation distance, da = 1 − |ρ|, where ρ is some similarity measures, such as Pearson or Spearman correlation. How- ever, absolute correlation distance fails to fulfill the triangular inequality, which would have guaranteed better performance at vector quantization, allowed fast data localization, as well as sped up data clustering. In this work, we propose {$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://www.biorxiv.org/sites/default/files/highwire/biorxiv/early/2019/03/19/582106/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{$>$} as an alternative. We prove that dr satisfies the triangular equality when ρ represents Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, or Cosine similarity. We empirically compared dr with da in gene clustering and sample clustering experiment, using real biological data. The two distances performed similarly in both gene cluster and sample cluster in hierarchical cluster and PAM cluster. However, dr demonstrated more robust clustering. According to bootstrap experiment, the number of times where dr generated more robust sample pair partition is significantly (p-value {$<$} 0.05) larger. This advantage in robustness is also supported by the class “dissolved” event.},

However, these biomarkers are often part of a battery of tests, and it is difficult to integrate them together to gain an overall view of an organism’s health. The aim of this study was to develop an index that could integrate the data derived from a battery of biomarkers for application to both spatial and temporal studies. Mya arenaria clams were collected at different sites along the Saguenay Fjord (Quebec, Canada). Six biomarkers were measured: metallothioneins, DNA strand breakage, lipid peroxidation, vitellin-like proteins, phagocytosis, and non-specific esterase activity in haemocytes. A biomarker index was obtained by summing the biomarker values expressed in term of classes. Classes were determined by a distribution-free approach derived from the theory of rough sets. The results of the spatial study show that the index values discriminated well between contaminated and uncontaminated sites. The highly polluted sites had the highest index values (18 compared with a reference value of 14). In the temporal study, the index was also able to highlight possible contamination-induced alterations, even though the interpretation of temporal variation is complicated by natural variations occurring throughout the year. A control chart approach is proposed for determining contaminated sites in both spatial and temporal surveys.},

However, the integration of multiple measurements on the health status of organisms into a model for site discrimination is challenging. This study compares two discrimination methods which are based on rule inference: rough sets (RS) analysis and classification trees (CT) with classical multivariate discriminant analysis (DA). Site classification was attempted with six biomarkers of effects: metallothionein levels, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, levels of lipophosphoproteins (i.e., vitellins), phagocytosis activity and haemocyte cell viability on clam (Mya arenaria) populations from the Saguenay River fjord (Quebec, Canada). Rule based methods have the advantage of complete independence from data distribution constraints in contrast to the classification methods from multivariate analysis that are more commonly used in ecotoxicology. Results show that RS and CT gave better classifications than DA because they do not require strong distributional assumptions. Moreover, RS provided classification rules that could identify the most important biomarker(s) for site discrimination. RS and CT were shown to be simple and efficient methods for classifying multivariable ecotoxicological data. This methodology would be especially useful when freedom from distributional assumptions is required.},

The isolation of RNA can be completed in about 1 h, and DNA and proteins in about 3 h. The simultaneously isolated RNA, DNA and proteins are ready for Northern, Southern and Western blotting. The complete recovery of DNA from samples used for the RNA and protein isolation makes it possible to normalize the results of gene expression studies based on DNA content instead of on the more variable total RNA, protein content or tissue weight.},

The pygidium forms and begins to differentiate prior to segmentation. The first indication of each new segment is the appearance of a large pair of segmental blood vessels which arise from the vascular complex in the gut wall. Associated with these are fibroblasts, the anlagen of the new septum. Epidermal derivatives develop subsequently, appearing first ventrolaterally, close to the regenerating nerve cord. The mitotic rate appears to be highest prior to the period of maximum segment formation. Visible cell differentation follows, and subsequent growth of segments is primarily by cell enlargement. It appears likely that the blood-vascular system associated with the gut and the regenerating nerve cord, both of which are disproportionately large in the regenerate, are important for the initiation of new segments.},

  abstract = {In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi-species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others, Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often-quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self-consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically-relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example ‘sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C’. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non-parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded that they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.},

Observational series have accumulated over the past 2–5 decades from measurements across the world's estuaries, bays, lagoons, inland seas and shelf waters influenced by runoff. We synthesize information contained in these time series to develop a global view of changes occurring in marine systems influenced by connectivity to land. Our review is organized around four themes: (i) human activities as drivers of change; (ii) variability of the climate system as a driver of change; (iii) successes, disappointments and challenges of managing change at the sea-land interface; and (iv) discoveries made from observations over time. Multidecadal time series reveal that many of the world's estuarine–coastal ecosystems are in a continuing state of change, and the pace of change is faster than we could have imagined a decade ago. Some have been transformed into novel ecosystems with habitats, biogeochemistry and biological communities outside the natural range of variability. Change takes many forms including linear and nonlinear trends, abrupt state changes and oscillations. The challenge of managing change is daunting in the coastal zone where diverse human pressures are concentrated and intersect with different responses to climate variability over land and over ocean basins. The pace of change in estuarine–coastal ecosystems will likely accelerate as the human population and economies continue to grow and as global climate change accelerates. Wise stewardship of the resources upon which we depend is critically dependent upon a continuing flow of information from observations to measure, understand and anticipate future changes along the world's coastlines.},

  abstract = {Humans impact natural systems in a multitude of ways, yet the cumulative effect of multiple stressors on ecological communities remains largely unknown. Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative effects in individual studies were additive (26\%), synergistic (36\%), and antagonistic (38\%). The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in ecological studies and conservation planning.},

First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

Some species nevertheless succeed in such harsh milieus, raising the question of their tolerance to environmental stress. The annelid Hediste diversicolor lives buried in the sediments, directly exposed to contaminants trapped in the mud. After verifying the similarity of their genetic contexts, we compared reproductive output and individual immune resistance measures of populations living in polluted vs. ‘clean’ sediments, and related these assessments with measures of phthalates and metal pollution, and associated toxicity indices. Chemical analyses predicted no toxicity to the local infauna, and phenological studies evidenced no direct cost of living in noxious habitats. However, populations exposed to pollutants showed a significantly reduced survival upon infection with a local pathogen. Surprisingly, physiological studies evidenced a basal overinflammatory state in the most exposed populations. This over-activated baseline immune phenotype likely generates self-damage leading to enhanced immune cell death rate and immune failure. Monitoring the immune status of individual worms living in anthropic areas could thus be used as a reliable source of information regarding the actual health of wild populations.},

However, the lack of effective interpretational capacity has hampered their uptake for use for assessment of risk in environmental management. The aim of the present study was to develop and test an objective decision-support or expert system capable of integrating biomarker results into a five-level health-status index. The expert system is based on a set of rules derived from available data on responses to natural and contaminant-induced stress of marine mussels. Integration of parameters includes: level of biological organization; biological significance; mutual inter-relationship; and qualitative trends in a stress gradient. The system was tested on a set of biomarker data obtained from the field and subsequently validated with data from previous studies. The results demonstrate that the expert system can effectively quantify the biological effects of different levels of pollution. The system represents a simple tool for risk assessment of the harmful impact of contaminants by providing a clear indication of the degree of stress syndrome induced by pollutants in mussels.},

Endpoints analyzed included activity of enzymes involved in glycolysis (pyruvate kinase, PK; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), Krebs cycle (citrate synthase, CS; isocitrate dehydrogenase; IDH), electron transport chain (electron transport system, ETS) and pentose phosphate pathway (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH). Coral polyps were kept under control conditions (25.0\,±\,0.1\,°C; 2.9\,±\,0.7\,μg/L Cu) or exposed to combined treatments of increasing temperature (26.6\,±\,0.1\,°C and 27.3\,±\,0.1\,°C) and concentrations of dissolved Cu (5.4\,±\,0.9 and 8.6\,±\,0.3\,μg/L) for 4 and 12 days using a mesocosm system. PK activity was not affected by stressors. LDH, CS, IDH, ETS and G6PDH activities were temporally inhibited by stressors alone. CS, ETS and G6PDH activities remained inhibited by the combination of stressors after 12 days. Furthermore, all combinations between increasing temperature and exposure Cu were synergistic after prolonged exposure. Taken together, stressors applied alone led to temporary inhibitory effects on energy metabolism enzymes of the coral M.~harttii, however, prolonged exposure reveals strong deleterious effects over the metabolism of corals due to the combination of stressors. The present study is the first one to give insights into the combined effects of increasing temperature and Cu exposure in the energy metabolism enzymes of a scleractinian coral. Findings suggest that moderate Cu contamination in future increasing temperature scenarios can be worrying for aerobic and oxidative metabolism of M.~harttii.},

  abstract = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects where treatments are not replicated and/or replicates are not statistically independent. It is a genuine but controversial issue in ecology particularly in the case of costly landscape-scale manipulations, behavioral studies where ethics or other concerns may limit sample sizes, ad hoc monitoring data, and the analysis of natural experiments where chance events occur at a single site. Here key publications on the topic are reviewed to illustrate the debate that exists about the conceptual validity of pseudoreplication. A survey of ecologists and case studies of experimental design and publication issues are used to explore the extent of the problem, ecologists’ solutions, reviewers’ attitudes, and the fate of submitted manuscripts. Scientists working across a range of ecological disciplines regularly come across the problem of pseudoreplication and build solutions into their designs and analyses. These include carefully defining hypotheses and the population of interest, acknowledging the limits of statistical inference and using statistical approaches including nesting and random effects. Many ecologists face considerable challenges getting their work published if accusations of pseudoreplication are made – even if the problem has been dealt with. Many reviewers reject papers for pseudoreplication, and this occurs more often if they haven't experienced the issue themselves. The concept of pseudoreplication is being applied too dogmatically and often leads to rejection during review. There is insufficient consideration of the associated philosophical issues and potential statistical solutions. By stopping the publication of ecological studies, reviewers are slowing the pace of ecological research and limiting the scope of management case studies, natural events studies, and valuable data available to form evidence-based solutions. Recommendations for fair and consistent treatment of pseudoreplication during writing and review are given for authors, reviewers, and editors.},

Fifteen mussels {$>$}25 mm shell length were analyzed from each of the 13 sampling sites. Significant differences between sites were noted for all biomarkers, but the general level of variability was low. Three biomarkers (DNA, LPO and VG) exhibited a similar pattern of spatial variation while MT and EROD had distinct and specific patterns. MT had the strongest discriminating power and EROD showed the largest range of variation among sites. Highest biomarker responses were measured in specimens from local contaminated sites such as harbors and industrial sectors. A positive relationship was found between MT and copper (Cu), but no significant correlation was observed between other biomarker responses and the levels of ten trace metals bioaccumulating in the zebra mussels tissues. Results indicate that the measurement of biomarker responses is technically feasible. The performance of each biomarker is assessed in the context of the role and advantages of selecting a battery of biomarkers for detecting contamination problems. The use of zebra mussels as a sentinel species for biomonitoring potential toxic effects in situ is discussed.},

  abstract = {Redox-sensitive trace metals are powerful tools for the reconstruction of modern and past redox conditions in aquatic ecosystems. The most prominent example is molybdenum (Mo), which behaves conservatively as soluble molybdate in the oxygenated ocean, but forms particle-reactive thiomolybdates at sufficiently high sulfide concentrations. Previous studies proposed that the redox behavior of tungsten (W), the geochemical twin of Mo, is also affected by sulfide, suggesting its potential as a promising new redox proxy. Here we present a comprehensive W dataset from the highly sulfidic Black Sea and the weakly sulfidic Landsort Deep (Baltic Sea), as the type localities of modern euxinic basins, that combines water column, pore water, and sediment records. A dataset from the Gotland Basin obtained following oxygenation of the formerly euxinic water column during the major Baltic inflow in 2014 is used as the hypoxic example. The even stronger adsorption of W than Mo on Mn and Fe oxides at pelagic redoxclines identified these particles as important carrier transferring W from the oxygenated surface ocean to euxinic bottom waters. This shuttling was most pronounced during the inflow event in the Gotland Basin causing substantial deposition of Mn oxides that were highly enriched in W. Compared to the oxygenated surface waters, dissolved Mo was severely depleted in the highly sulfidic water column of the Black Sea, whereas the bottom water levels of dissolved W were elevated. An additional W source derived from pore-water reflux, as indicated by the exceptionally high concentrations of W in highly sulfidic pore waters from the Landsort Deep sediments. In addition to the decoupling from Mn, the pore water W enrichments are compatible with the previously proposed greater solubility of thiotungsate species than of tungstate. Despite the absence of a substantial sedimentary accumulation of authigenic W in the sapropels of the Black Sea, the comparable patterns of S, Fe, and W in an Eemian record may suggest sorption of internally cycled (thio)tungstate onto pyrite. Unexpected W enrichments in modern and medieval sediments from the central Landsort Deep indicate a close relationship with Mn carbonate formation occurring during long-lasting bottom water hypoxia. In contrast to the highly variable Mo content, the near-background variation of W in the sapropels of euxinic basins questions the utility of W as a redox proxy in euxinic systems. However, given the strong affinity between W and the Mn/Fe cycle, this element may be a useful proxy in hypoxic systems, especially its isotopic signature.},

For this reason, the impacts of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) under different seawater salinity conditions were evaluated on the common ragworm Hediste diversicolor, a polychaete species widely used as bioindicator of estuarine environmental quality. An innovative method to assess the presence of MWCNT aggregates in the sediments was used for the first time. Biomarkers approach was used to evaluate the metabolic capacity, oxidative status and neurotoxicity of polychaetes after long-term exposure. The results revealed an alteration of energy-related responses in contaminated polychaetes under both salinity conditions, resulting in an increase of metabolism and expenditure of their energy reserves (lower glycogen and protein contents). Moreover, a concentration-dependent toxicity (higher lipid peroxidation, lower ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione and activation of antioxidant defences and biotransformation mechanisms) was observed in H. diversicolor, especially when exposed to low salinity. Additionally, neurotoxicity was observed by inhibition of Cholinesterases activity in organisms exposed to MWCNTs at both salinities.},

Moreover salinity is considered one of the main factors influencing nanoparticles' stability. Thus, the aim of the present paper was to show the impacts induced by different salinities (control-28 and 21) on the chemical behavior of water dispersible multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs-COOH) and the consequent toxicity in the common ragworm Hediste diversicolor, after long term exposure. Results showed a concentration-dependent toxicity in terms of energy reserves and metabolism, oxidative status and neurotoxicity. In addition, under low salinity (21), the toxicity of the carbon NMs was similar to the impacts measured under control (28), although under salinity 28 the concentrations of MWCNTs-COOH used generated greater alterations in LPO levels and antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GPx). These results demonstrate that higher salinity caused the formation of large-size aggregates, which increased the chance of physical retention, such as gravitational sedimentation, interception and straining of f-MWCNTs generating higher cell injuries than the impacts induced in polychaetes sensitivity to these contaminates due to low salinity.},

Among them, the development of biomarker-based procedures, that combine precocity and relevance, is recommended. However, multi-biomarker approaches are often hard to interpret, and produce results that are not easy to integrate in the environmental policies framework. Integrative index have been developed, and one of the most used is the integrated biomarker response (IBR). However, an analysis of available literature demonstrated that the IBR suffers from a frequent misuse and a bias in its calculation. Then, we propose here a new calculation method based on both a more simple formula and a permutation procedure. Together, these improvements should rightly avoid the misuse and bias that were recorded. Additionally, a case study illustrates how the new procedure enabled to perform a reliable classification of site along a pollution gradient based on biomarker responses used in the IBR calculations.},

  abstract = {Nanotechnology is a much promising field of science and technology with applications in a wide range of areas such as electronics, biomedical applications, energy and cosmetics. Metal-based engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are common in many technological applications; some of the most common nanoparticles available commercially are silver, gold, copper oxide (CuO), zinc oxide (ZnO) and cadmium sulphide (CdS). The toxicity of metal-based NPs may be either due to their specific physical characteristics as NPs or to the specific toxicity of metals released from NPs under environmental conditions. In this study we evaluated the toxicity effects of a range of ENPs (Ag, Au, CuO, CdS, ZnO) along with a control containing equivalent quantities of dissolved metal on two endobenthic species: the ragworm Hediste diversicolor and the bivalve Scrobicularia plana. A suite of complementary biomarkers was used to reveal toxicity effects. A common challenge in multibiomarkers studies is to go beyond an independent interpretation of each one, and to assess a global response of individuals. The Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) was calculated for both species exposed to the different metal-based ENPs studied or to their dissolved metal counterpart to provide efficient and easy tools for environmental managers. We evidence that metal-based NPs lead to an overall difference in biological responses from that of their dissolved counterparts. The IBR could thus be considered as an efficient tool to transfer research results to stakeholders with possible implementation for regulatory purposes.},

  abstract = {Public health campaigns encourage people to protect themselves against skin cancer by using sunscreens and taking other protective measures. The objective is to estimate the impact of these campaigns on the rise of awareness among the general public. This study explores the prevalence and predictors of solar protection behaviour in a sample of beachgoers and compares these results to another similar study carried out 9 years earlier (i.e. summer 2001). During the month of August 2010, a total of 408 participants (144 men and 264 women) were randomly selected on their way to the Belgian beach in the city of Ostend, Belgium. The solar protection behaviour of each participant was assessed by direct observation and an interview. The exact same questions were asked as in 2001. The general risk awareness stays the same for skin aging and skin cancer but gets higher for sunburn. When we control these results for sex, the overall higher general awareness is completely because of the higher awareness of the female subgroup. As in 2001, risk awareness is considerably higher in the female subgroup than in the male one. As in 2001, sunscreen cream was the most popular preventive behaviour in 2010 (use of sunscreen with sun protection factor 15 or higher reported by 66.4\%), followed by timed sun exposure (46.8\%), use of clothing and hats (36.8\%) and shade (34.1\%). As in summer 2001 the sunscreen use is more popular in the female population. The use of protective clothing and hats is more popular in the male group. As solar protection has become part of the beach behaviour routine, there is room for improvement for their more frequent application, the use of a higher sun protection factor (15+), timed sunbathing, more use of clothing and hats and seeking shade. The results of this study can assist in evaluating the effectiveness of present sun-protection campaigns and health education programmes.},

  abstract = {In marine ecosystems, rising atmospheric CO2 and climate change are associated with concurrent shifts in temperature, circulation, stratification, nutrient input, oxygen content, and ocean acidification, with potentially wide-ranging biological effects. Population-level shifts are occurring because of physiological intolerance to new environments, altered dispersal patterns, and changes in species interactions. Together with local climate-driven invasion and extinction, these processes result in altered community structure and diversity, including possible emergence of novel ecosystems. Impacts are particularly striking for the poles and the tropics, because of the sensitivity of polar ecosystems to sea-ice retreat and poleward species migrations as well as the sensitivity of coral-algal symbiosis to minor increases in temperature. Midlatitude upwelling systems, like the California Current, exhibit strong linkages between climate and species distributions, phenology, and demography. Aggregated effects may modify energy and material flows as well as biogeochemical cycles, eventually impacting the overall ecosystem functioning and services upon which people and societies depend.},

  abstract = {Temperature and trace metals are common environmental stressors, and their importance is increasing due to global climate change and anthropogenic pollution. Oxidative damage and antioxidant properties have been studied in liver and gills of the European bullhead (Cottus gobio) subjected to cadmium (CdCl2 at nominal concentrations of 0.01 and 1mg/L) for 4days at either 15°C or 21°C. First, exposure to 1mg Cd/L induced a high mortality rate (67\%) in fish held at 21°C. Regarding the antioxidant enzymes, exposure to 0.01mg Cd/L significantly increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased the activity of glutathione reductase (GR) in liver, independently of heat stress. In gills, exposure to 21°C resulted in a significantly increased activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), whereas the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) was significantly reduced as compared to fish exposed to 15°C. Furthermore, regardless of Cd stress, exposure to elevated temperature resulted in a significant decrease of lipid peroxidation (LPO) level in liver and in a significant increase in the activity of chymotrypsin-like 20S proteasome in both studied tissues of C. gobio. Overall, the present results indicated that elevated temperature and cadmium exposure independently influenced the antioxidant defense system in bullhead with clear tissue-specific and stress-specific antioxidant responses. Further, elevated temperature affected the hepatic lipid peroxidation and the activity of 20S proteasome in both tissues.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, the term "heavy metals" has been widely used. It is often used as a group name for metals and semimetals (metalloids) that have been associated with contamination and potential toxicity or ecotoxicity. At the same time, legal regulations often specify a list of "heavy metals" to which they apply. Such lists differ from one set of regulations to another and the term is sometimes used without even specifying which "heavy metals" are covered. However, there is no authoritative definition to be found in the relevant literature. There is a tendency, unsupported by the facts, to assume that all so-called "heavy metals" and their compounds have highly toxic or ecotoxic properties. This has no basis in chemical or toxicological data. Thus, the term "heavy metals" is both meaningless and misleading. Even the term "metal" is commonly misused in both toxicological literature and in legislation to mean the pure metal and all the chemical species in which it may exist. This usage implies that the pure metal and all its compounds have the same physicochemical, biological, and toxicological properties, which is untrue. In order to avoid the use of the term "heavy metal", a new classification based on the periodic table is needed. Such a classification should reflect our understanding of the chemical basis of toxicity and allow toxic effects to be predicted.},

  abstract = {Estuaries are subject to anthropogenic activities. Because the intrasedimentary worm Nereis diversicolor has ecological characteristics and bioindicator abilities, its use was pertinent in investigating the concepts and cost of tolerance to heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Zn). In this context, two approaches were carried out, performing toxicity tests and estimating energy reserves (glycogen and lipids), in populations originating from a contaminated site (Seine estuary) compared with those from a clean site (Authie estuary). Mean lethal times (LT50s) of organisms exposed to zinc from the Seine estuary were higher than those from the Authie estuary, but not of organisms exposed to Cd or Cu. The influence of animal weight and salinity on the sensitivity of worms also was studied. The biggest worms were more tolerant to zinc than the smallest ones, and worms survived longer at a reduced salinity (15‰). Concentrations of glycogen and lipids in each sampling season were higher in specimens from the Authie estuary than in worms from the Seine estuary. No influence of salinity on glycogen and lipid levels was observed. Glycogen concentrations were not influenced by the weight of specimens, whereas lipid concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with weight. In conclusion, worms from the Seine estuary exhibited tolerance to Zn, and the depletion of energy reserves observed in this population could be interpreted as a cost of tolerance. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The chemical analyses of worms and sediments allowed the designation of the Seine estuary and the Authie estuary as a polluted and relatively clean site respectively. Worms from the Seine estuary exhibited higher GST and lower AChE activities. Generally, larger worms had higher concentrations of energy reserves. Principal component analyses clearly highlighted intersite differences: in the first plan, GST activities and chemical concentrations were inversely related to concentrations of energy reserves; in the second one, PCB concentrations and AChE activity were inversely related. Depleted levels of energy reserves could be a consequence of combating toxicants and might predict effects at higher levels of biological organization. The use of GST and AChE activities and energy reserve concentrations as biomarkers is validated in the field in this keystone species.},

Among these biomarkers, those linked to reproduction are most probably related to populational effects. To test this hypothesis, Nereis diversicolor were collected in the multipolluted Seine estuary and the comparatively clean Authie estuary (France). Energy reserves were higher in Authie worms, suggesting a better physiological status. The number of oocytes per female was higher for the polychaetes from the Authie, but it was related to the size of animals, which was higher at this site. Densities of worms were depleted in the Seine compared to those in Authie. Demographic structure of the Seine population was also altered. The concomitant changes in energy reserves, egg production, and population structure and density suggest that the effects on biomarkers and at the population level are related.},

  abstract = {Experimental studies in biomedical research frequently pose analytical problems related to small sample size. In such studies, there are conflicting findings regarding the choice of parametric and nonparametric analysis, especially with non-normal data. In such instances, some methodologists questioned the validity of parametric tests and suggested nonparametric tests. In contrast, other methodologists found nonparametric tests to be too conservative and less powerful and thus preferred using parametric tests. Some researchers have recommended using a bootstrap test; however, this method also has small sample size limitation. We used a pooled method in nonparametric bootstrap test that may overcome the problem related with small samples in hypothesis testing. The present study compared nonparametric bootstrap test with pooled resampling method corresponding to parametric, nonparametric, and permutation tests through extensive simulations under various conditions and using real data examples. The nonparametric pooled bootstrap t-test provided equal or greater power for comparing two means as compared with unpaired t-test, Welch t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and permutation test while maintaining type I error probability for any conditions except for Cauchy and extreme variable lognormal distributions. In such cases, we suggest using an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test. Nonparametric bootstrap paired t-test also provided better performance than other alternatives. Nonparametric bootstrap test provided benefit over exact Kruskal–Wallis test. We suggest using nonparametric bootstrap test with pooled resampling method for comparing paired or unpaired means and for validating the one way analysis of variance test results for non-normal data in small sample size studies.

  abstract = {Increasing population pressure, urbanisation of the coastal zone and nutrient and sediment run-off from agriculture and forestry has increased the number of large-scale and chronic impacts affecting coastal and estuarine systems. The need to assess cumulative impacts is a major motivation for the current desire of managers and ecologists to define ecosystem “health” and “stress”. A number of univariate metrics have been proposed to monitor health, including indicator species, indicator ratios and diversity or contaminant metrics. Alternatively, multivariate methods can be used to test for changes in community structure due to stress. In this study we developed multivariate models using statistical ordination techniques to identify key stressors affecting the ‘health’ of estuarine macrofaunal communities. Macrofaunal and associated environmental samples were collected across 75 sites from within Tauranga Harbour, a large estuary located on New Zealand's North Island. The harbour receives discharges from urbanised, industrial, agricultural and horticultural catchments. Distance-based linear modelling identified sediments, nutrients and heavy metals as key ‘stressors’ affecting the ecology of the harbour. Therefore, three multivariate models were developed based on the variability in community composition using canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP). The multivariate models were found to be more sensitive to changing environmental health than simple univariate measures (abundance, species richness, evenness and Shannon–Wiener diversity) along an anthropogenic stress gradient. This multivariate approach can be used as a management or monitoring tool where sites are repeatedly sampled over time and tracked to determine whether the communities are moving towards a more healthy or unhealthy state. Ultimately, such statistical models provide a tool to forecast the distribution and abundance of species associated with habitat change and should enable long-term degradative change from multiple disturbances to be assessed.},

Design and Methods: A new generation, more stable, colored 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical cation (ABTS*+) was employed. The ABTS*+ is decolorized by antioxidants according to their concentrations and antioxidant capacities. This change in color is measured as a change in absorbance at 660 nm. This process is applied to an automated analyzer and the assay is calibrated with Trolox. Results: The novel assay is linear up to 6 mmol Trolox equivalent/l, its precision values are lower than 3\%, and there is no interference from hemoglobin, bilirubin, EDTA, or citrate. The method developed is significantly correlated with the Randox- total antioxidant status (TAS) assay (r = 0.897, P {$<$} 0.0001; n = 91) and with the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay (r = 0.863, P {$<$} 0.0001; n = 110). Serum TAC level was lower in patients with major depression (1.69 ± 0.11 mmol Trolox equivalent/l) than in healthy subjects (1.75 ± 0.08 mmol Trolox equivalent/l, P = 0.041). Conclusions: This easy, stable, reliable, sensitive, inexpensive, and fully automated method described can be used to measure total antioxidant capacity.},

From the language and notation that is used to the conditions that students are told to check, there is usually no mention of randomized experiments until an example that is a randomized experiment is encountered, at which point the author(s) may offer a statement to the effect of “the randomization allows us to view the groups as independent random samples.” But a good student (or even an average one) should ask, “Why?”This paper shows, in a way easily accessible to students, why the usual inference procedures that are taught in an introductory course are often an appropriate approximation for randomized experiments even though the justification (the Central Limit Theorem) is based entirely on a random sampling model.},

The TNB molar absorption coefficient, 13.6×103M−1cm−1, as published by Ellman in 1959 has been almost universally used until now. Over the years, however, slightly different values have been published, and it has further been shown that TNB reveals thermochromic properties. This should be taken into account when the Ellman method is used for determination of enzyme activities, such as in cholinesterase assays. Our data show that the absorbance spectra of TNB are shifted to longer wavelengths when temperature increases, while absorbance maxima decrease. Our recommended molar absorption coefficients at 412nm are 14.15×103M−1cm−1 at 25°C and 13.8×103M−1cm−1 at 37°C (0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Molar absorption coefficients for other temperatures and wavelengths are included in the paper.},

  abstract = {Control strategies and routine biomonitoring programs are commonly performed worldwide using sentinel marine invertebrates, such as mussels of the genus Mytilus, for assessing the “health status” of the aquatic environment. Those species can accumulate and tolerate xenobiotics at levels higher than those being present into the aquatic environment, thus providing accurate and reliable biological endpoints (e.g. physiological, behavioral, cellular, biochemical and molecular indices) that can be measured in their tissues. Taking under consideration the significance of bivalves for assessing the environmental hazard of xenobiotics being present into the water medium, as well as the key role of digestive gland as a target-tissue for the compounds ingested in the organism, the present study aimed to summarize available data on the effects of different categories of xenobiotic compounds, previously characterized as a potential threat for the marine ecosystems. In this context, different types of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), biocides, microplastics (MPs) and nanoparticles (NPs), currently investigated in mussels' digestive gland, using a battery of experimental approaches and analytical methods, as well as stress indices evaluation, are briefly described and further discussed in order to elucidate not only the presence and the toxic mode of action of xenobiotics, but also the important role of the digestive gland as a reliable target-tissue for investigating the effects of xenobiotics at cellular, biochemical, and molecular levels.},

  abstract = {Nanoparticle toxicity is a growing concern in freshwater habitats. However, understanding of the nanoparticle effects on aquatic organisms is impeded by the lack of the studies of the nanoparticles effects in the environmentally relevant context of multiple stress exposures. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (n-ZnO) are widely used metal-based nanoparticles in electronics and personal care products that accumulate in aquatic environments from multiple non-point sources. In this study, we evaluated the effects of n-ZnO in a model organism, a mussel Unio tumidus, and the potential modulation of these effects by common co-occurring environmental stressors. Male U. tumidus were exposed for 14 days to n-ZnO (3.1μM), Zn2+ (3.1μM), Ca-channel blocker nifedipine (Nfd 10μM), combinations of n-ZnO and Nfd or n-ZnO and thiocarbamate fungicide Tattoo (Ta, 91μgL−1) at 18°C, and n-ZnO at 25°C (n-ZnO+t°). Total and metallothionein-bound Zn levels as well as levels of metallothioneins (MT), cellular stress responses and cytotoxicity biomarkers were assessed in the mussels. The key biomarkers that showed differential responses to different single and combined stressors in this study were activities of caspase-3 and lysosomal cathepsin D, as well as protein carbonyl content. At 18°C, exposures to n-ZnO, organic pollutants and their combinations led to a prominent up-regulation of MT levels (by ∼30\%) and oxidative stress response including up-regulation of superoxide dismutase activity, an increase in oxyradical production, and a 2–3-fold decrease in the levels of protein carbonyls in all exposures except nZnO+Ta. Expos ure to n-ZnO in the absence of other stressors also led to a strong (∼7-fold) elevation of cathepsin D activity. Cellular responses to Zn2+ and n-ZnO were different indicating that n-ZnO was not due exclusively to Zn release. Ca-channel blocker Nfd affected intracellular Zn distribution (reflected in the prominent elevation of Zn-MT levels) and caused reductive stress indicated by elevated levels of reduced glutathione levels and an increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio (reflecting higher NADH/NAD ratio). Elevated temperature (25°C) abolished most of the typical responses to n-ZnO and induced oxidative injury, DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 mediated apoptosis in n-ZnO-exposed mussels. DNA fragmentation was also induced by exposure to organic toxins (alone and in combination with n-ZnO) but not by n-ZnO alone. These data indicate that n-ZnO toxicity to freshwater organisms is modulated by organic pollutants and enhanced by elevated temperatures.},

We investigated the of in situ exposure history on molecular responses to a novel stressor, ionizing radiation, in unionid mollusks Anodonta anatina. Males from pristine (F-), agricultural (A-) sites and a cooling reservoir of a nuclear power plant (N-site) were exposed to acute low dose (2mGy) X-ray radiation followed by 14days of recovery (R-groups) or to control conditions (C-groups). Biomarkers of oxidative stress, geno-, cyto- and neurotoxicity were used to assess cellular injury and stress. Control group from the cooling reservoir (CN) had higher background levels of caspase-3 activity, metallothionein concentrations and nuclear lesions and lower levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione in the gills compared to other control groups (CF and CA). Irradiation induced cellular damage in mussels from all three sites including increased levels of nuclear lesions in hemocytes, depletion of caspase-3, suppression of superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, an increase of the lipid peroxidation and oxidized glutathione levels, as well as down-regulation of cholinesterase indicating neurotoxicity. The up-regulation of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity in the digestive gland and vitellogenin-like protein level in gonads were also found in radiation-exposed groups indicating feminization of males and disturbances of xenobiotic metabolism. The RA-group showed the greatest magnitude of radiation-induced stress responses compared to the other two groups. Overall, unionid mollusks, particularly those from a chronically polluted agricultural site, were highly sensitive to low-dose radiation (2mGy) indicating limitations of stress protection mechanisms to deal with multiple stressors.},

Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod coatings show promise as an antifouling material; however, the toxicity of ZnO nanorods to marine organisms is not known. We compared the toxicity of suspended ZnO nanorods (NR) with that of ZnO nanoparticles (NP) and ionic Zn2+ in a marine bivalve Mytilus edulis exposed for two weeks to 10 or 100\,μg Zn L−1 of ZnO NPs, NRs or Zn2+, or to immobilized NRs. The multi-biomarker assessment included bioenergetics markers (tissue energy reserves, activity of mitochondrial electron transport system and autophagic enzymes), expression of apoptotic and inflammatory genes, and general stress biomarkers (oxidative lesions, lysosomal membrane stability and metallothionein expression). Exposure to ZnO NPs, NRs and Zn2+ caused accumulation of oxidative lesions in proteins and lipids, stimulated autophagy, and led to lysosomal membrane destabilization indicating toxicity. However, these responses were not specific for the form of Zn (NPs, NR or Zn2+) and showed no monotonous increase with increasing Zn concentrations in the experimental exposures. No major disturbance of the energy status was found in the mussels exposed to ZnO NPs, NRs, or Zn2+. Exposure to ZnO NPs and NRs led to a strong induction of apoptosis- and inflammation-related genes, which was not seen in Zn2+ exposures. Based on the integrated biomarker response, the overall toxicity as well as the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory action was stronger in ZnO NPs compared with the NRs. Given the stability of ZnO NR coatings and the relatively low toxicity of suspended ZnO NR, ZnO NR coating might be considered a promising low-toxicity material for antifouling paints.},

Atorvastatin (ATO), a globally prescribed drug, is environmentally stable and bioavailable to marine organisms; however, the physiological and toxic effects of this drug on ecologically important coastal species are yet to be elucidated. We studied the effect of ATO (˜1.2\,μg L−1) on bioenergetics (including whole-organism and mitochondrial respiration, as well as tissue energy reserves and mRNA expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid metabolism in the gills and the digestive gland) of a keystone bivalve Mytulis edulis (the blue mussel) from the Baltic Sea. Xenobiotic detoxification systems including activity and mRNA expression of P-glycoprotein, and Phase I and II biotransformation enzymes (cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP1A and glutathione transferase, GST) were also assessed in the gill and digestive gland of the mussels. Exposure to ATO caused rapid uptake and biotransformation of the drug by the mussels. Standard metabolic rate of ATO-exposed mussels increased by 56\% indicating higher maintenance costs, yet no changes were detected in the respiratory capacity of isolated mitochondria. ATO exposure led to ˜60\% decrease in the lysosomal membrane stability of hemocytes and ˜3-fold decrease in the whole-organism P-glycoprotein-driven and diffusional efflux of xenobiotics indicating altered membrane properties. The digestive gland was a major target of ATO toxicity in the mussels. Exposure of mussels to ATO led to depletion of lipid, carbohydrate and protein pools, and suppressed transcription of key enzymes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha PGC-1α) and fatty acid metabolism (acetyl-CoA carboxylase and CYP4Y1) in the digestive gland. No bioenergetic disturbances were observed in the gills of ATO-exposed mussels, and elevated GST activity indicated enhanced ATO detoxification in this tissue. These data demonstrate that ATO can act as a metabolic disruptor and chemosensitizer in keystone marine bivalves and warrant further investigations of statins as emerging pollutants of concern in coastal marine ecosystems.},

Here we assessed the toxicity of UV filters ensulizole and octocrylene in the blue mussels Mytilus edulis exposed to 10 or 100 μg l−1 of octocrylene and ensulizole for two weeks. An integrated battery of biochemical and molecular biomarkers related to xenobiotics metabolism and cellular toxicity (including oxidative stress, DNA damage, apoptosis, autophagy and inflammation) was used to assess the toxicity of these UV filters in the mussels. Octocrylene (but not ensulizole) accumulated in the mussel tissues during the waterborne exposures. Both studied UV filters induced sublethal toxic effects in M. edulis at the investigated concentrations. These effects involved induction of oxidative stress, genotoxicity (indicated by upregulation of DNA damage sensing and repair markers), upregulation of apoptosis and inflammation, and dysregulation of the xenobiotic biotransformation system. Octocrylene induced cellular stress in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas ensulizole appeared to be more toxic at the lower (10 μg l−1) studied concentration than at 100 μg l−1. The different concentration-dependence of sublethal effects and distinct toxicological profiles of ensulizole and octocrylene show that the environmental toxicity is not directly related to lipophilicity and bioaccumulation potential of these UV filters and demonstrate the importance of using bioassays for toxicity assessment of emerging pollutants in coastal marine ecosystems.},

Here, we evaluated the individual and mixture toxicities of Roundup and chlorpyrifos in environmentally relevant concentrations to zebrafish using molecular and biochemical indices. Studied pesticides alone and in combination caused depletion of total antioxidant capacity and cellular thiols, overproduction of ROS, accumulation of oxidative lesions and elevated DNA damage in zebrafish liver. Notably, low concentration of Roundup induced a hormesis-like effect by stimulating the protective cellular mechanisms. Chlorpyrifos showed stronger prooxidant effects than Roundup and additionally caused nitrosative and carbonyl stress in zebrafish. At the organismal level, studied pesticides and their mixtures induced hepato- and neurotoxicity. The effects of the studied pesticides on biomarkers of apoptosis, endocrine disruption and immune disorders were generally weak and inconsistent. The multibiomarker assessment showed that chlorpyrifos is considerably more toxic than Roundup to zebrafish. The toxic effects of the pesticide mixtures were mostly driven by chlorpyrifos, with minimal or mitigating effects of Roundup addition. These findings elucidate the toxic mechanisms of common pesticides in a model vertebrate and demonstrate that health hazards of pesticide mixtures cannot be predicted from the effects of single pesticides.},

  abstract = {Electron transport system activity (ETS) and respiration rates (R) of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, were determined monthly from April to November over 2 years at two sites in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. The sites were located in the inner and outer bay and contrasted in food quantity and quality. ETS ranged from 2 to 40 μg O2 mg DW−1 h−1 over the study period. Both ETS and respiration were strongly related to temperature, and maximum values were found between June and August. ETS also peaked in June/July when assays were conducted at a constant temperature (25 °C), indicating other factors besides temperature affected metabolic activity. R:ETS ratios decreased with increased temperature at the inner bay site, but trends were minimal at the outer bay site. In late summer, blooms of the cyanophyte Microcystis occurred in the inner bay, likely depressing filtration rates, and leading to lower respiration rates relative to ETS. ETS activity was consistently higher in the outer bay and was likely a result of higher food quality. Despite these spatial differences, annual mean R:ETS ratios varied only from 0.04 to 0.09 at the two sites over the 2-year period. Based on these values, ETS may be useful as an indicator of long-term metabolic activity in annual energy budgets of D. polymorpha. However, food conditions differentially affect respiration relative to ETS, and variability in this ratio must be considered when interested in shorter time scales.},

  abstract = {Dichotomization is the transformation of a continuous outcome (response) to a binary outcome. This approach, while somewhat common, is harmful from the viewpoint of statistical estimation and hypothesis testing. We show that this leads to loss of information, which can be large. For normally distributed data, this loss in terms of Fisher's information is at least 1 − 2/π (or 36\%). In other words, 100 continuous observations are statistically equivalent to 158 dichotomized observations. The amount of information lost depends greatly on the prior choice of cut points, with the optimal cut point depending upon the unknown parameters. The loss of information leads to loss of power or conversely a sample size increase to maintain power. Only in certain cases, for instance, in estimating a value of the cumulative distribution function and when the assumed model is very different from the true model, can the use of dichotomized outcomes be considered a reasonable approach.

  abstract = {Aquatic sediments feature a two-way interaction between contaminants and benthic macrofauna. The effect of the macrofauna community on the transport of contaminants in sediment has received considerable attention. Yet, few studies have investigated the reverse effect, i.e., the influence of contaminants on bioturbation activity. To this end, we performed laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of copper contamination on sediment reworking activity of the ragworm Nereis diversicolor. A density of 570 ind m2 was introduced in mesocosms containing natural and copper spiked (2.99 nmol Cu g−1) cohesive intertidal sediments from Ponta da Erva (Tejo estuary, Portugal). Luminophore tracers were used to quantify sediment reworking activity over time (2, 7, 14 and 21 days). Bioturbation was quantified via biodiffusion coefficients (Db) using two different parameter estimation routines. In the first days, luminophore concentrations at depth were significantly lower under Cu contamination. Yet, after 14 days, profiles showed no longer differences, indicating that N. diversicolor is able to maintain a normal activity under the applied Cu contamination. Bioturbation activity of N. diversicolor shows a clear non-local signature, generating a faster penetration of tracer particles at depth than expected by a diffusive mechanism. We show that for this mode of bioturbation, Db values become highly dependent on the actual optimisation algorithm used in the parameter estimation procedure. This puts into question the appropriateness of the biodiffusion model for N. diversicolor bioturbation and may have important repercussions for the comparison of Db values between studies.},

  abstract = {Global change projections predict significant impacts on the aquaculture sector leading to a substantial interest in the study of species' ecophysiological responses to increased temperature and shifting salinities. Here, we experimentally evaluated shifts on the fatty acid (FA) profiles of the ragworm Hediste diversicolor under global and local ocean change drivers. This polychaete is a suitable extractive organism for integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) designs, as it maximizes the use of otherwise wasted nutrients present in particulate organic matter of farm effluents. Ragworms were collected from intertidal mudflats and subjected to an experimental trial of 28~days under control (24~°C), warming (27~°C) and heatwave (30~°C) scenarios combined with salinity variations (20 and 30) in a full factorial design. Individuals were sampled after 14 and 28~days of exposure (D14 and D28 respectively) for FA profile analysis. Interactions between temperature x day and salinity x day modulated ragworms' fatty acid profiles. Overall, an increase in different FA classes, as well as in ∑n-3 UFA, ∑n-6 UFA and essential fatty acids (EFA) was detected over time in polychaetes exposed to salinity 30, contrary to what was observed in salinity 20. This suggests that salinity 30 is an optimal condition for H. diversicolor FA enrichment. At this salinity, fatty acids from n-3 and n-6 families remained stable at 24~°C and 27~°C, with a decrease being detected at 30~°C (after 14~days of exposure), possibly related to changes in the lipid composition of cell membranes to maintain homeostasis. However, after 28~days, no differences were detected, suggesting that polychaetes can acclimate to elevated temperatures when they are in optimal salinity conditions. In contrast, if an extreme warm event (30~°C) is combined with low salinity (20), all FA classes increase at day 14 and HUFA class remain elevated after 28~days, while ∑n-3 UFA, ∑n-6 UFA, ARA, EPA and DHA decrease, suggesting their potential role in osmotic balance and membrane fluidity. Still, if ragworms are grown at low salinity and the increase in temperature is only moderate, ∑n-3 UFA, ∑n-6 UFA, ARA, EPA and DHA increase. This study shows that heatwaves can have an impact on H. diversicolor aquaculture, especially under low salinity conditions, by decreasing EFA. Risk assessment and adaptation strategies need to be implemented into aquaculture practices to mitigate the impacts of global change on the nutritional profile of farmed species and their overall commercial value.},

Model predictions were compared to empirical results of laboratory experiments measuring interactions among thermal stress, toxin exposure, and low food on reproduction and survival of two species of cladoceran zooplankton. Stress was defined operationally as a reduction in reproduction or survival relative to optimal conditions over a 7-d period. These experiments are particularly applicable to episodic stresses such as those associated with short-term heat waves. Toxin or low food in combination with 30C temperatures were generally more harmful than high temperature alone. However, most multiple stress effects were antagonistic, in that effects in combination were not as severe as predicted based on the sum or the product of their individual effects. In rare cases, interaction among stressors even diminished effects of the worst single stressor. Optimal conditions for reproduction and survival occurred at 25C, high food and 0 mg liter-1 toxin (a surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate). Suppressive effects of stressors examined individually ranked: high temperature (30C) {$>$} SDS (10 mg liter-1 ɥ low food (∼100 mg C liter-1) {$>$} low temperature (20C).

  abstract = {The ragworm Nereis diversicolor has been proposed as a sentinel species for the assessment of estuarine sediment quality. The aim of this study was to test the responsiveness of the worms using a battery of biomarkers in specimens from a moderately contaminated site (Loire estuary, Fr.) and a comparatively cleaner site (Bay of Bourgneuf, Fr.) as a reference site. Ragworms were collected on 7 occasions from April 2008 to October 2009 for the determination of biochemical (GST, AChE, digestive enzymes), physiological (energy reserves (glycogen, lipids and proteins), relationship between length and weight), and behavioural (feeding and burrowing) biomarkers. The biomarker responses were tentatively interpreted in terms of the concept of cascading events potentially responsible for local depletion/extinction of populations submitted to chemical stress. Impairments of AChE and amylase activities, feeding rate, energy reserve concentrations (glycogen and lipids), and the relationship between length and weight showed up differences between the reference site and the Loire estuary despite the latter being far from the most contaminated estuary in France or internationally. However, no links could be established in the Loire estuary ragworms between effects at infra-individual and individual levels, nor with worm population density, even though a small oil spill had occurred in the Loire estuary only one month before the beginning of sampling.},

  abstract = {A mechanistic model has been developed to characterize and quantify sediment-mixing due to macrobenthic organisms that construct gallery systems. The mixing model is time- and space- dependent and employs ordinary differential equations. It uses (1) biological parameters‹the size of the bioturbated zone, rate of biodiffusion and rate of biotransport; (2) physical parametes‹output to the water-column coefficient and rate of physical mixing due to local water currents; and (3) biogeochemical parameters‹decay rate of the tracer. This gallery-diffusor model is based on a combination of 2 processes: biodiffusion in the sediment layer containing very dense gallery systems, and biotransport in the region of tube bottoms. The performance of this gallery-diffusor model is compared with that of the biodiffusor model classically used to describe mixing of such organisms. Both models are applied to conservative tracer profiles measured in laboratory experiments with the polychaete Nereis diversicolor. Our new model provides mechanisms to describe and explain the tracer-profile shapes observed in sediments. It includes rapid particle transport from the upper layer of the sediment to the tube bottom zone, which is not taken into account with the biodiffusor model but which is of great importance in understanding the processes of organic matter degradation in the sedimentary column. It also makes possible the accurate quantification of the different components of the mixing process of an organism (in this study, the polychaete N. diversicolor). The gallery-diffusor model constitutes 1 of 5 elementary components in a global bioturbation model that allows the study, quantification and prediction of sediment reworking by macrobenthic communities according to their functional group and composition and/or to the specific characteristics of the individual organisms.},

  abstract = {Seawater pH is among the environmental factors controlling the performance of marine organisms, especially in calcifying marine invertebrates. However, changes in non-calcifying organisms (including polychaetes) may also occur due to pH decrease. Polychaetes are often the most abundant group of organisms in estuarine systems, representing an important ecological and economic resource. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the impacts of seawater acidification in the polychaete Hediste diversicolor, a species commonly used as bioindicator. For this, organisms were exposed to different pH levels (7.9, 7.6 and 7.3) during 28 days and several biochemical markers were measured. The results obtained demonstrated that pH decrease negatively affected osmotic regulation and polychaetes metabolism, with individuals under low pH (7.6 and 7.3) presenting higher carbonic anhydrase activity, lower energy reserves (protein and glycogen content) and higher metabolic rate (measured as Electron transport system activity). The increase on CA activity was associated to organisms osmoregulation capacity while the increase on ETS and decrease on energy reserves was associated to the polychaetes capacity to develop defense mechanisms (e.g. antioxidant defenses). In fact, despite having observed higher lipid peroxidation at pH 7.6, in polychaetes at the lowest tested pH (7.3) LPO levels were similar to values recorded in individuals under control pH (7.9). Such findings may result from higher antioxidant enzyme activity at the lowest tested pH, which prevented organisms from higher oxidative stress levels. Overall, our study demonstrated how polychaetes may respond to near-future ocean acidification conditions, exhibiting the capacity to develop biochemical strategies which will prevent organisms from lethal injuries. Such defense strategies will contribute for polychaetes populations maintenance and survival under predicted seawater acidification scenarios.},

Polychaetes were exposed during 28days to low pH (7.5), Hg (5μg/L) and pH7.5+Hg, and physiological alterations (respiration rate), biochemical markers related to metabolic potential (glycogen and protein content, electron transport system activity) and oxidative status (activity of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes, lipid peroxidation) were evaluated. The results obtained clearly showed that polychaetes were sensitive to low pH and Hg contamination, both acting alone or in combination. Organisms used their energy reserves under stressful conditions, which decreased by up to half of the control content, probably to fuel defence mechanisms. Our findings further demonstrated that polychaetes exposed to these stressors presented increased antioxidant defence mechanisms (3 fold compared to control). However, organisms were not able to prevent cellular damage, especially noticed at Hg exposure and pH7.5. Overall, although all the tested conditions induced oxidative stress in Hediste diversicolor, the combined effect of seawater acidification and Hg contamination did not induce higher impacts in polychaetes than single stressor exposures. These findings may indicate that predicted climate change scenarios may not increase Hediste diversicolor sensitivity towards Hg and may not significantly change the toxicity of this contaminant to this polychaete species.},

Lack of appropriate analytical methods for trace determinations in aquatic ecosystem compartments and lack of information regarding their toxicity explains existing regulation gaps. However, suspicion of their toxicity assigned them as Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs). Among CECs are Pharmaceuticals including Salicylic Acid (SA), which is the active metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential effects of SA on the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. For this, organisms were exposed for 28 days to different concentrations of SA (0.005; 0.05; 0.5 and 5\,mg/L), resembling low to highly polluted sites, after which different physiological and biochemical parameters were evaluated to assess organism’s respiration rate, neurotoxic, metabolic and oxidative stress status. Our results clearly showed that SA strongly reduced the respiration capacity of mussels. Also, SA inhibited the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes, but increased the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), which prevented the occurrence of lipid peroxidation (LPO). Nevertheless, oxidative stress was confirmed by the strong decrease of the ratio between reduce glutathione (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in contaminated mussels. Moreover, neurotoxicity was observed in mussels exposed to SA. Overall, this study demonstrates the metabolic, neurotoxic and oxidative stress impacts of SA in M. galloprovincialis, which may result in negative consequences at the population level.},

  abstract = {Many evaluations estimating safe levels of hydrophobic organic chemicals in sediments do not account for confounding factors such as physical habitat quality or covariance among chemicals. Controlled experiments demonstrating cause and effect can be conducted with spiked sediment toxicity tests, but application of this methodology has been limited in part by concerns about chemical bioavailability and challenges in achieving target concentrations. Relevant literature was reviewed to assess the utility of standardizing sediment equilibration times; hydrophobicity, complex sediment characteristics, and temperature were identified as potentially equally important factors. Disequilibrium appears likely following limited equilibration time but should yield conservative toxicity test results relative to aged field sediments. Nominal and measured concentrations in over 20 published studies were compared to assess spiked chemical recovery (i.e., measured concentration/nominal concentration). Recovery varied substantially among studies and was not readily predictable based on spiking or extraction method, chemical properties, or measured sediment characteristics, although unmeasured differences between sediments appeared to be important. Factors affecting specific studies included chemical adsorption to glassware, biodegradation, and volatilization. Pre- and post-toxicity test analyses are recommended to confirm exposure concentrations. Studies with 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) exemplify the utility of verifying results of field studies using spiked sediment tests. Sediments spiked with these chemicals at concentrations greatly exceeding those in associated field studies caused no adverse effects in test organisms, demonstrating that other chemicals co-occurring in test sediment samples caused toxicity initially attributed to 2,3,7,8-TCDD and HCB in the field studies. Another key application of spiked sediment tests has been the investigation of TOC as the primary factor affecting bioavailability of hydrophobic organic chemicals. A review of LC50s for nine chemicals reported in 12 studies shows that comparable LC50s derived in different sediments generally agree within a factor of five when concentrations are normalized to a constant TOC. Additionally, use of spiked sediment toxicity testing to investigate toxicological interactions among chemicals provides a promising approach to improving the ability to predict sediment toxicity in the field.},

In this way, predictions serve as an important bridge between abstract hypotheses and concrete experiments. Experimental biologists, however, generally receive little guidance on how to generate quality predictions. Here, we identify two important components of good predictions – criticality and persuasiveness – which relate to the ability of a prediction (and the experiment it implies) to disprove a hypothesis or to convince a skeptic that the hypothesis has merit. Using a detailed example, we demonstrate how striving for predictions that are both critical and persuasive can speed scientific progress by leading us to more powerful experiments. Finally, we provide a quality control checklist to assist students and researchers as they navigate the hypothetico-deductive method from puzzling observations to experimental tests.},

All heavy metals, whether biologically essential or not, have the potential to be toxicto organisms at a threshold bioavailability. Such threshold concentrations vary betweenmetals, between species and with the physicochemical characteristics of the medium, somelike copper being particularly toxic even though essential in trace amounts. Responses ofanimals to metals in their medium or food depend to a large extent on the ability of speciesto regulate levels attained in their tissues. Higher animals have the capacity to regulate levelsof many metals, while marine invertebrates can regulate some within certain limits. Whereanimals cannot regulate physiological levels of metals, an alternative strategy is to detoxifyand store metals in relatively harmless forms. Knowledge of the manner in which animals deal with potentially toxic concentrations of heavy metals is of fundamental importance in the assessment of metal pollution by analysis of metal levels in biological samples. The interaction of heavy metals with biological materials is a key theme running through this volume. Toxic effects may be reflected at the individual, population, or ecosystem level, affecting species composition and production levels, or may be of direct dietary significance to man. The global cycling of metals through the marine environment is crucially affected by biological processes."--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {Copper (Cu) is an integral part of many important enzymes involved in a number of vital biological processes. Although normally bound to proteins, Cu may be released and become free to catalyze the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Data obtained from in vitro and cell culture studies are largely supportive of Cu's capacity to initiate oxidative damage and interfere with important cellular events. Oxidative damage has been linked to chronic Cu-overload and/or exposure to excess Cu caused by accidents, occupational hazards, and environmental contamination. Additionally, Cu-induced oxidative damage has been implicated in disorders associated with abnormal Cu metabolism and neurodegenerative changes. Interestingly, a deficiency in dietary Cu also increases cellular susceptibility to oxidative damage. A number of nutrients have been shown to interact with Cu and alter its cellular effects. Vitamin E is generally protective against Cu-induced oxidative damage. While most in vitro or cell culture studies show that ascorbic acid aggravates Cu-induced oxidative damage, results obtained from available animal studies suggest that the compound is protective. High intakes of ascorbic acid and zinc may provide protection against Cu toxicity by preventing excess Cu uptake. Zinc also removes Cu from its binding site, where it may cause free radical formation. Beta-carotene, alpha-lipoic acid and polyphenols have also been shown to attenuate Cu-induced oxidative damage. Further studies are needed to better understand the cellular effects of this essential, but potentially toxic, trace mineral and its functional interaction with other nutrients.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the cumulative effects of exposure to either dissolved zinc or nanozinc oxide (nanoZnO) and air-time survival in freshwater mussels. Mussels were exposed to each forms of zinc for 96h then placed in air to determine survival time. A sub-group of mussels before and after 7days of exposure to air were kept aside for the determination of the following biomarkers: arachidonate-dependent cyclooxygenase (COX) and peroxidase (inflammation and oxidative stress), lipid metabolism (total lipids, esterases activity, HO-glycerol, acetyl CoA and phospholipase A2) and lipid damage (lipid peroxidation [LPO]). The results showed that air-time survival was decreased from a mean value of 18.5days to a mean value of 12days in mussels exposed to 2.5mg/L of nanoZnO although it was not lethal based on shell opening at concentrations below 50mg/L after 96h. In mussels exposed to zinc only, the median lethal concentration was estimated at 16mg/L (10–25 95\% CI). The air-time survival did not significantly change in mussels exposed to the same concentration of dissolved Zn. Significant weight losses were observed at 0.5mg/L of nanoZnO and at 2.5mg/L for dissolved zinc chloride, and were also significantly correlated with air-time survival (r=0.53; p{$<$}0.01). Air exposure significantly increased COX activity in control mussels and in mussels exposed to 0.5mg/L of nanoZnO and zinc chloride. The data also suggested fatty acid breakdown and β-oxidation. Mussels exposed to contaminants are more susceptible to prolonged exposure to air during low water levels.},

  abstract = {Considering the ecological importance and potential value of Hediste diversicolor, a better understanding of its metabolic rate and potential growth rates is required. The aims of this study are: (i) to describe key biometric relationships; (ii) to test the effects of temperature and body size on standard metabolic rate (as measure by oxygen consumption) to determine critical parameters, namely Arrhenius temperature (TA), allometric coefficient (b) and reaction rate; and (iii) to determine the metabolic scope for activity (MSA) of H. diversicolor for further comparison with published specific growth rates. Individuals were collected in a Mediterranean lagoon (France). After 10 days of acclimatization, 7 days at a fixed temperature and 24 h of fasting, resting oxygen consumption rates (VO2) were individually measured in the dark at four different temperatures (11, 17, 22 and 27 °C) in worms weighing from 4 to 94 mgDW (n = 27 per temperature). Results showed that DW and L3 were the most accurate measurements of weight and length, respectively, among all the metrics tested. Conversion of WW (mg), DW (mg) and L3 (mm) were quantified with the following equations: DW = 0.15 × WW, L3 = 0.025 × TL(mm) + 1.44 and DW = 0.8 × L33.68. Using an equation based on temperature and allometric effects, the allometric coefficient (b) was estimated at 0.8 for DW and at 2.83 for L3. The reaction rate (VO2) equaled to 12.33 µmol gDW−1 h−1 and 0.05 µmol mm L3−1 h−1 at the reference temperature (20 °C, 293.15 K). Arrhenius temperature (TA) was 5,707 and 5,664 K (for DW and L3, respectively). Metabolic scope for activity ranged from 120.1 to 627.6 J gDW−1 d−1. Predicted maximum growth rate increased with temperature, with expected values of 7–10\% in the range of 15–20 °C. MSA was then used to evaluate specific growth rates (SGR) in several experiments. This paper may be used as a reference and could have interesting applications in the fields of aquaculture, ecology and biogeochemical processes.},

A substantial number of integrated environmental risk assessments have been developed in Europe, North America and many other regions for these situations. In contrast, comparatively few empirical studies have been conducted for human and veterinary pharmaceuticals that are likely to enter coastal and marine ecosystems. This is a critical knowledge gap given the significant increase in coastal human populations around the globe and the growth of coastal megacities, together with the increasing importance of coastal aquaculture around the world. There is increasing evidence that pharmaceuticals are present and are impacting on marine and coastal environments. This paper reviews the sources, impacts and concentrations of pharmaceuticals in marine and coastal environments to identify knowledge gaps and suggests focused case studies as a priority for future research.},

A sediment transfer experiment showed that the Blackwater worms responded to the increased copper bioavailability in Restronguet Creek sediment by accumulating significantly increasing copper concentrations over 50~days. The Restronguet Creek worms showed no significant change in copper concentration over 50~days in sediment from either site or in sand. Nevertheless, electron microscopy showed that some Restronguet Creek worms do appear to excrete accumulated copper, probably in association with renewal of the cuticle over a long time scale. The Blackwater worms did not accumulate extra zinc from the zinc-rich Restronguet Creek sediment, in probable reflection of the regulation of body zinc concentration by N. diversicolor. Radiolabelled zinc and cadmium were accumulated from labelled sediment and labelled solution by worms from both sites. The rate of uptake of labelled zinc from sediment was significantly greater in the Restronguet Creek worms, as was the rate of uptake of labelled cadmium from 10~μg~l−1 dissolved exposure; other rates of uptake did not differ between populations. Mucus, which is secreted by Restronguet Creek worms in response to enhanced copper exposure, adsorbed very small proportions of zinc and cadmium present in solution, indicating that the mucus does not act as an adsorption barrier against excessive metal uptake by these worms.},

  abstract = {Background Sunscreen is recommended to prevent sunburn and skin cancer. Objectives To investigate sunscreen use in relation to demographic and phenotypic characteristics among women in Norway, as well as solar UV exposure, sunburn experience in different decades of life, and temporal trends in sunscreen use. Methods We used data from the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study, a large population-based prospective cohort study. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the association between sunscreen use and personal characteristics. Results are presented as prevalence ratios (PRs) and 99\% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The study sample consisted of 148 869 women, with a mean age, when answering the questionnaire, of 53 years (range 41–75). Sixty-five per cent of the women used sunscreen during the Easter holiday, 73\% in northern latitudes and 87\% in bathing vacations in southern latitudes. Sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) ≥ 15 was used by 25 156 (18\%) at Easter, 18 118 (13\%) in northern latitudes and 22 678 (30\%) in southern latitudes. The prevalence of sunscreen use increased from 1997 to 2007, and this increase was associated with age. In 1997, 39\% of women reported at least one sunburn per year in the recent decade, compared with 46\% in 2007 (Ptrend = 0·001). Women who experienced at least four sunburns per year during adolescence reported more sunscreen use in adulthood (PREaster 1·54, 99\% CI 1·30–1·83; PRnorthern latitudes 1·49, 99\% CI 1·20–1·84; PRsouthern latitudes 1·37, 99\% CI 1·14–1·65). Conclusions The prevalence of sunscreen use increased from 1997 to 2007. However, this increase has not been accompanied by a decrease in sunburn. Moreover, use of sunscreen with the recommended SPF was not common among Norwegian women.},

  abstract = {Toxicity caused by exposure to pollutants from marine sediments is a consequence of the interaction between biota and xenobiotics most frequently released by anthropogenic activities. The present work intended to characterize the toxicity of natural sediments putatively impacted by distinct human activities, collected at several sites located in the south of the Gulf of Gabes, Zarzis area, Tunisia. The selected toxicity criteria were analysed following ecologically relevant test conditions. Organisms of the polychaete species Hediste diversicolor were chronically exposed (28~days) to the mentioned sediments. Toxicity endpoints were biomarkers involved in the toxic response to common anthropogenic chemicals, namely neurotoxic (acetylcholinesterase), anti-oxidant (catalase, glutathione peroxidase), metabolic (glutathione S-transferases) enzymatic activities, and oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation, TBARS assay). The chemical characterization of sediments showed that the samples collected from the site near an aquaculture facility were highly contaminated by heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg, Pb, and Zn) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene). H. diversicolor individuals exposed to the sediments from this specific site showed the highest values among all tested biomarkers, suggesting that these organisms were possibly under a pro-oxidative stress condition potentially promoted by anthropogenic pollution. Moreover, it was possible to conclude that individuals of the polychaete species H. diversicolor responded to the chronic exposure to potentially contaminated sediments from the southeast coast of Tunisia, eliciting adaptive responses of significant biological meaning.},

Some may think that Newton’s cautionary note, which was in keeping with an experimental approach espoused by Francis Bacon, is inapplicable to current experimental method since, in accord with the philosopher Karl Popper, modern-day hypotheses are framed to serve as instruments of falsification, as opposed to verification. But Popper’s “critical rationalist” framework too is problematic. It has been accused of being: inconsistent on philosophical grounds; unworkable for modern “large science,” such as systems biology; inconsistent with the actual goals of experimental science, which is verification and not falsification; and harmful to the process of discovery as a practical matter. A criticism of the hypothesis as a framework for experimentation is offered. Presented is an alternative framework—the query/model approach—which many scientists may discover is the framework they are actually using, despite being required to give lip service to the hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Pharmaceuticals are important environmental stressors since they have a worldwide use; they are usually released in the aquatic compartment without adequate treatment, and because of their intrinsic properties, they may affect several non-target organisms. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), the active substance of aspirin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, being one of the most widely prescribed analgesics in human medical care. Consequently, this compound is systematically reported to occur in the wild, where it may exert toxic effects on non-target species, which are mostly uncharacterized so far. The objective of the present work was to assess the acute and chronic effects of ASA on selected oxidative stress biomarkers [catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GRed), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST)], lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance), and histological alterations in the polychaete Hediste diversicolor (Annelida: Polychaeta). The obtained data showed that ASA is not exempt of toxicity, since it was responsible for significant, albeit transient, changes in biomarkers related to the redox status of the organisms, occurring as an increase in the activity of catalase in the individuals exposed acutely to ASA. Chronic exposure to ecologically relevant concentrations of this drug showed to be mostly ineffective in promoting any significant biochemical alteration in H. diversicolor. However, histochemical observations revealed proliferation of mucous cells in the tegument of chronically exposed individuals to ASA.},

  abstract = {Mussel gill cells are attractive models in ecotoxicological studies because gills are the first uptake site for many toxicants in the aquatic environment; gill cells are thus often affected by exposure to pollutants. Our aim was to characterize mussel gill cells in vivo and in vitro by using morphological, histochemical and functional end-points. In paraffin sections stained with haematoxylin–eosin, three zones were distinguished in the long central gill filaments: frontal, intermediate and abfrontal. Various types of ciliated cells were present in the frontal zone, and both ciliated and non-ciliated cells were found in the abfrontal zone. The intermediate zone was comprised of flattened endothelial cells. Lipofuscin granules occurred in the three zones in variable amounts, depending on the specimen. Haemocytes were found in the haemolymph sinus of gill filaments. Mucocytes were identified in both frontal and abfrontal zones by means of periodic acid Schiff-alcian blue (PAS-AB) staining. In cryostat sections, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity was mainly found in ciliated cells, whereas neutral lipids and acid-phosphatase-reactive lysosomes were present in all portions of the gill filament, mostly being related to lipofuscin granules. In mussels exposed to 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine in vivo, proliferating cells were scattered throughout the gill filament. Gill cells (typically 2×107 cells/ml per mussel; 95\% viability) were isolated by dissociation with dispase. Gill cell suspensions were heterogeneous: 58\% were ciliated epithelial cells (positive for SDH), 42\% were non-ciliated cells (including epithelial cells and haemocytes), 2.3\% were mucocytes (positive for PAS-AB) and 4.25\% were haemocytes (able to phagocytose neutral red-stained zymosan). Gill cell cultures were maintained up to 18 days without changing the culture medium, viability decreasing below 50\% at day 18. Primary cultures of mussel gill cells might therefore be useful models for the in vitro assessment of xenobiotic impacts on coastal and estuarine ecosystems.},

Environmental quality assessment in this compartment can provide useful information to control pollution in coastal areas. Lately, implementation of Environmental Legislative Frameworks within the European Community is increasing awareness about the importance of marine sediment quality in order to achieve a “Good Environmental Status.” In this work, the study of superficial marine sediments allowed assessment of source and fate of heavy metals in a semi-enclosed deep embayment that is subjected to severe anthropogenic activities. Results indicated that accumulation of heavy metals takes place mainly in proximity to anthropogenic sources (industrial area and harbors), but pollution can also spread to greater depths affecting the whole ecosystem. Multivariate statistics helped identify source and fate of several elements, showing evidence of pollutants transfer from urban wastewaters, industrial effluents, and atmospheric emissions to marine sediments. Results provided useful information for the implementation and development of Environmental Management Strategies under European Legislative Frameworks.},

Use of biomarkers to assess the pollution effects assumes that the effects of pollutants on the biomarkers exceed the natural background variability; yet this assumption has rarely been tested. We exposed mussels at different reproductive stages and nutritive states to two concentrations of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (fluoranthene, 3 and 60~μg~L−1) for three weeks. Expression levels of the molecular biomarkers related to the detoxification and general stress response [cytochrome P450 oxidase (CYP450), glutathione S-transferases (GST-α; GST-S1; GST-S2), the multixenobiotic resistance protein P-glycoprotein (PgP), metallothioneins (MT10 and MT20), heat shock proteins (HSP22, HSP70-2; HSP70-3; HSP70-4), as well as mRNA expression of two reproduction-related genes, vitellogenin (Vitel) and vitelline coat lysin M7 (VCLM7)] were measured. The mussels’ nutrition and reproductive state affected the baseline mRNA levels of molecular biomarkers and modulated the transcriptional responses of biomarker genes to the pollutant exposure. Thus, mussel physiological state could act as a confounding factor in the evaluation of the response of pollution through molecular biomarkers. The biomarker baseline levels must be determined across a range of physiological states to enable the use of biomarkers in monitoring programs.},

Ephemeroptera and Diptera are the most commonly investigated orders of insect larvae, whilst many orders are not represented at all. The collector–gatherer and predator feeding guilds are more frequently investigated than other guilds. Furthermore, Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd are the most intensively researched heavy metals, and only infrequent investigations of other metals are documented. Relationships between metal concentrations in the animals and levels in sediments and waters were determined from the pooled data for three feeding guilds. No one relationship represents how each metal interacts within the feeding guilds. Each of the four metals (Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd) displays a unique relationship between metal concentrations in sediments or waters with those in individual feeding guilds of macro-invertebrates, indicating the relative importance of different sources of metals to the different feeding types. Biomagnification of Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd has been demonstrated not to occur between these guilds.},

  abstract = {Increased anthropogenic emission of CO2 changes the carbonate chemistry and decreases the pH of the ocean. This can affect the speciation and the bioavailability of metals in polluted habitats such as estuaries. However, the effects of acidification on metal accumulation and stress response in estuarine organisms including bivalves are poorly understood. We studied the interactive effects of CO2 and two common metal pollutants, copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd), on metal accumulation, intracellular ATP/ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, stress response and energy metabolism in two common estuarine bivalves—Crassostrea virginica (eastern oyster) and Mercenaria mercenaria (hard shell clam). Bivalves were exposed for 4–5 weeks to clean seawater (control) and to either 50μgL−1 Cu or 50μgL−1 Cd at one of three partial pressures of CO2 (PCO2 ∼395, ∼800 and ∼1500μatm) representative of the present-day conditions and projections of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) for the years 2100 and 2250, respectively. Clams accumulated lower metal burdens than oysters, and elevated PCO2 enhanced the Cd and Cu accumulation in mantle tissues in both species. Higher Cd and Cu burdens were associated with elevated mRNA expression of metal binding proteins metallothionein and ferritin. In the absence of added metals, proteasome activities of clams and oysters were robust to elevated PCO2, but PCO2 modulated the proteasome response to metals. Cd exposure stimulated the chymotrypsin-like activity of the oyster proteasome at all CO2 levels. In contrast, trypsin- and caspase-like activities of the oyster proteasome were slightly inhibited by Cd exposure in normocapnia but this inhibition was reversed at elevated PCO2. Cu exposure inhibited the chymotrypsin-like activity of the oyster proteasome regardless of the exposure PCO2. The effects of metal exposure on the proteasome activity were less pronounced in clams, likely due to the lower metal accumulation. However, the general trends (i.e. an increase during Cd exposure, inhibition during exposure to Cu, and overall stimulatory effects of elevated PCO2) were similar to those found in oysters. Levels of mRNA for ubiquitin and tumor suppressor p53 were suppressed by metal exposures in normocapnia in both species but this effect was alleviated or reversed at elevated PCO2. Cellular energy status of oysters was maintained at all metal and CO2 exposures, while in clams the simultaneous exposure to Cu and moderate hypercapnia (∼800μatm PCO2) led to a decline in glycogen, ATP and ADP levels and an increase in AMP indicating energy deficiency. These data suggest that environmental CO2 levels can modulate accumulation and physiological effects of metals in bivalves in a species-specific manner which can affect their fitness and survival during the global change in estuaries.},

  abstract = {Polychaetes are vital for evaluating the effects of toxic metals in marine systems, and sensitive molecular biomarkers should be integral to monitoring efforts. However, the few polychaete markers that exist are inconsistent, even within the same species, failing to identify gene expression changes in metal-exposed animals incurring clear metabolic costs. Comparing previously characterised polychaete metal-responsive genes with those of another carefully selected species could identify biomarkers applicable across polychaetes. The ragworm Alitta virens (Sars, 1835) is particularly suited for such comparisons due to its dominance of fully saline coastal areas, widespread distribution, large biomass, and its phylogenetic position relative to other polychaete ‘omic’ resources. A transcriptome atlas for A. virens was generated and an RNASeq-qPCR screening approach was used to characterise the response to chronic exposures of environmentally relevant concentrations of copper and zinc in controlled mesocosms. Genes presenting dramatic expression changes in A. virens were compared with known metal-responsive genes in other polychaetes to identify new possible biomarkers and assess those currently used. This revealed some current markers should probably be abandoned (e.g. Atox1), while others, such as GST-Omega, should be used with caution, as different polychaete species appear to upregulate distinct GST-Omega orthologues. In addition, the comparisons give some indication of genes that are induced by metal exposure across phylogenetically divergent polychaetes, including a suite of haemoglobin subunits and linker chains that could play conserved roles in metal-stress response. Although such newly identified markers need further characterisation, they offer alternatives to current markers that are plainly insufficient.},

It then discusses several properties of P-values that have been presented as fatal flaws: That P-values exhibit extreme variation across samples (and thus are “unreliable”), confound effect size with sample size, are sensitive to sample size, and depend on investigator sampling intentions. These properties are often criticized from a likelihood or Bayesian framework, yet they are exactly the properties P-values should exhibit when they are constructed and interpreted correctly within their originating framework. Other common criticisms are that P-values force users to focus on irrelevant hypotheses and overstate evidence against those hypotheses. These problems are not however properties of P-values but are faults of researchers who focus on null hypotheses and overstate evidence based on misperceptions that p = 0.05 represents enough evidence to reject hypotheses. Those problems are easily seen without use of Bayesian concepts by translating the observed P-value p into the Shannon information (S-value or surprisal) –log2(p).},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of the mining industry, the pollution of heavy metal(loid)s in soils near copper (Cu) mining sites is a significant concern worldwide. However, the pollution status and probabilistic health risks of heavy metal(loid)s of soils associated with Cu mines, have rarely been studied on a global scale. In this study, eight heavy metal(loid) concentrations in soil samples taken near 102 Cu mining sites worldwide were obtained through a literature review. Based on this database, the heavy metal(loid) pollution and ecological risk in soils near Cu mines were evaluated. Most of the study sites exceeded the moderately to heavily polluted levels of Cu and Cd; compared to other regions, higher pollution levels were observed at sites in Oman, China, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Soil pollution by Cd, Pb, and Zn at agricultural sites was higher than that in non-agricultural sites. In addition, these heavy metal(loid)s produced a high ecological risk to soils around Cu mining sites in which the contribution of Cd, Cu, and As reached up to 46.5\%, 21.7\%, and 18.4\%, respectively. The mean hazard indices of the eight heavy metal(loid)s were 0.209 and 0.979 for adults and children, respectively. The Monte Carlo simulation further predicted that 1.40\% and 29.9\% of non-carcinogenic risk values for adults and children, respectively, exceeded the safe level of 1.0. Moreover, 84.5\% and 91.0\% of the total cancer risk values for adults and children, respectively, exceeded the threshold of 1E-04. Arsenic was the main contributor to non-carcinogenic risk, while Cu had the highest exceedance of carcinogenic risk. Our findings indicate that the control of Cu, Cd, and As should be prioritized because of their high incidence and significant risks in soils near Cu mines. These results provide valuable inputs for policymakers in designing effective strategies for reducing the exposure of heavy metal(loid)s in this area worldwide. Heavy metal pollution in the Danube Delta (in sediments, water and living organisms) has recently received increasing attention due to its impact on ecosystems health and water quality. However, long term records of heavy metal contamination are not available to date. In this study radiometric dating and geochemical analyses for major elements (Al, Fe, Ca and S) and metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr and Cd) were performed on the top 4 m of a 9-m sediment core retrieved from the alluvial plain of Sulina distributary channel aiming to reconstruct the heavy metal geological background and contamination history and discuss the possible origins (natural vs. anthropogenic) of metals and the main factors driving their temporal variation. Chronological analysis revealed that the top 4 m of the core span the last \textasciitilde 600 years. Three distinct sediment units (U1: 400–200, U2: 200–140, U3: 140–15) were identified based on the downcore element concentration variation. The lower unit (400–200 cm, \textasciitilde 1450–1700 CE) shows an upward increase of Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr and Cd metal contents, which are strongly correlated with Al. Enrichment factor (EF) analysis indicates that metals detected in this unit are derived primarily from natural sources. In contrast, metals show elevated EF values within the middle (200–140 cm, \textasciitilde 1700–1770 CE) and upper unit (140–15 cm, \textasciitilde 1770 CE to present). The highest degrees of enrichment of Cu, Zn and Cd occur in the peat layer of the middle unit (U2) which displays higher organic carbon and sulfur contents, indicating that diagenetic enrichment of detected metals occurs under reducing condition. Overall, sediment contamination is moderate while the level increases with time. This study provides new insights into the metal contamination history of deltaic environments and yields baseline values for heavy metal contents in pristine sediments deposited prior to the onset of anthropogenic impact.},

Although each of the four enzymes can be identified by its reactivity with specific substrates, all of the enzymes are active to differing degrees in the conjugation of glutathione with p-nitrobenzyl chloride. Assay conditions for a variety of substrates are included. All four glutathione transferases have a molecular weight of 45,000 and are dissociable into subunits of approximately 25,000 daltons.

In addition to incorporating the compliance of chemical quality standards, the key objective of the WFD is the general protection of the aquatic environment in its entirety. This new approach emphasizes the need for an integrated environmental risk assessment and offers the potential for the incorporation of biological effects measures, including the use of biomarkers in this process. Biomarkers have been suggested as practical tools for environmental management for a number of decades, but their inclusion has not been universally accepted because of a number of unanswered questions regarding sensitivity, practicality, and reproducibility. With this in mind, this paper addresses these potential questions and shows how, by taking a weight-of-evidence approach, biomarkers may be successfully incorporated within environmental risk assessment frameworks such as the WFD.},

The BRI, based on a suite of biomarkers at different levels of biological response at the individual level, provides an integrated relative measure of the general health status of coastal invertebrates. Using the BRI, the health of mussels (Mytilus edulis) from 10 estuaries classified by the Environment Agency of England and Wales under the WFD was compared. Eight sites were healthier than predicted and two showed a similar health status to that of the predicted point-source pollution risk classification. Results indicate that the BRI offers a potential measure of organism health that can be used in monitoring under the WFD as an additional aid to reduce uncertainty in defining risk classification and to provide better evidence of existing impact.},

This biomarker response could be interpreted as a reduction in fecundity and increased risk of local extinction. However, abundance estimates from the same area has not provided any evidence of a reduction in population size. In the present study, a matrix population model was developed to investigate if a reduction in fecundity can be expected to have long term effects on population viability for perch and to evaluate the probability to detect such effects through abundance estimates. The model was parameterized from 17 years of population data from Kvädöfjärden as well as from other studies on perch. The model included density dependence and environmental stochasticity. The results indicated that a reduction in fecundity that is in level with the observed reduction in relative gonad size in Kvädöfjärden will cause a substantial risk for local extinction. The risk that the population will fall below 20\% of the carrying capacity within 50 years is 44\% when the fecundity is reduced by 40\%. However, due to variability in abundance measurements it will take some time before a reduction in gonad size leads to statistically significant effects on the population. If the fecundity is reduced by 40\% successively over a 10-year period, the probability to detect this through abundance estimates within 10 years is less than 50\%. The results of the present study clearly show that relevant biomarkers have an important role in environmental monitoring as early warning signals, preferably in combination with measurements at higher levels of biological organization.},

  abstract = {Since 1988, biomarkers in female perch (Perca fluviatilis) have been analyzed at a reference site on the Swedish Baltic coast. Strong time trends toward increasing hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and reduced gonadosomatic index (GSI) have been observed. This could be caused by pollutants as well as other factors, such as increasing water temperature or reduced mean age of sampled fish. Correlation analyses were used to find the most probable explanation for the time trends. The time trends were still significant for EROD (p {$<$} 0.001) and GSI (p {$<$} 0.001) when the correlations were controlled for age. Furthermore, increasing water temperature could not explain the time trends. Exposure to pollutants through runoff from land was found to be probable, because mean flow rate in a nearby river during the last 20 d before sampling correlated to EROD activity (p {$<$} 0.01). In addition, the sum of EROD activities during the life time of the perch (ERODlife) correlated significantly with GSI (p {$<$} 0.001). This suggests that perch exposed to more EROD-inducing chemicals during their lifetime have reduced or delayed gonad development. The time trend in GSI and the correlation between ERODlife and GSI were supported by data from a site in the Bothnian Bay (northern Baltic Sea; p {$<$} 0.05). The results indicate that increased rain fall (climate change) can affect the distribution and bioavailability of chemicals in coastal areas. The link between EROD and gonad size supports the common assumption that biochemical biomarkers can act as early warning signals for effects on higher levels, which commonly is difficult to show. The significant results can probably be attributed to the unique 20-year data set.},

Using multiple reference sites, the normal range can be estimated. This can be defined as the span that includes 95\% of the reference sites. If an investigated site is outside this range, it is interpreted as evidence of impact. The choice of reference sites is thus important for the outcome of the study. Here, biomarker levels in perch (Perca fluviatilis) at a potentially impacted site were compared to different types of reference data. The potentially impacted site was located close to a densely populated area. Four reference sites were located in relatively undisturbed areas on the Swedish Baltic coast. Furthermore, historical data from one of the reference sites were included. The present study showed that multiple reference sites are needed to avoid the risk of interpreting natural variation as impact. The number of reference sites needed depends on the desired level of statistical power. An alternative to multiple reference sites may be to use historical data to estimate the natural variation. However, historical data can include temporal variation due to factors that may not be relevant for the hypothesis that is tested, e.g., climatic variation or changed background levels of pollution.

The primary objective of this investigation, performed in 2003, was to test whether this was actually the case in an industrialised region in the County of Västernorrland in northern Sweden with well-documented environmental pollution from past and present activities. This was performed by measuring a moderate battery of simple biomarkers in adult female perch at several stations. The point sources included sewage-treatment plants, pulp and paper mills, as well as other industries. The biomarkers included growth, somatic indices, gonad maturation status, gonad pigmentation, fin erosion, skin ulcers, and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in the liver. The results showed that the environmental pollutants and their associated effects were not under control. In fact, the health of the perch was impaired at all of the polluted stations. Many responses were unspecific with respect to underlying cause, whereas some effects on EROD activity and gonad maturation status were attributed to historical creosote pollution and current kraft pulp mill effluents, respectively. The data presented may also be used as reference values for future investigations of health effects in perch.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few ‘leverage species’ may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations’ ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.},

Despite the desirability of interval scales, many dependent variables possess an ordinal scale of measurement in which the differences among values composing the scale are unequal in terms of what is being measured, permitting only a rank ordering of scores. This means that data possessing an ordinal scale will not satisfy the assumption of normality needed in many statistical procedures and may produce biased statistical results that threaten the validity of inferences. This article shows how the measurement technique known as item response theory can be used to rescale ordinal data to an interval scale. The authors provide examples of rescaling using student performance data and argue that educational researchers should routinely consider rescaling ordinal data using item response theory.},

  abstract = {Trace metal bioavailability is often evaluated on the basis of steady-state models such as the free ion activity model (FIAM) and the biotic ligand model (BLM). Some of the assumptions underlying these models were verified by examining Pb and Zn uptake by the green microalga Chlorella kesslerii. Transporter bound metal (M-Rcell) and free ion concentrations ([MZ+]) were related to experimentally determined uptake fluxes (Jint). Although the BLM and FIAM correctly predicted Pb uptake in the absence of competing ions, they failed to predict competitive interactions with Ca2+, likely because of modifications of the algal surface charge and the active nature of Ca2+ transport. Zinc transport is also active; in this case, both the internalization rate constant (kint) and the equilibrium constant for the binding of Zn to the transport sites (KZn-Rcell) varied as a function of [Zn2+] in the bulk solution. For this reason, Zn uptake could not be modeled by the steady-state models either in the presence or absence of competitors (Cd and Ca). Furthermore, the role of Cu on Pb and Zn adsorption and uptake could not be predicted by either model because of secondary effects on the algal physiology and membrane permeability. Finally, a 17°C reduction in temperature resulted in a two-to fivefold decrease in membrane permeability of the metals, an observation that also is unaccounted for by either the FIAM or BLM. This paper emphasizes the limitations of the models in well-controlled laboratory systems with the goal of extrapolating the results to complex environmental systems.},

These two GST families are believed to exert a critical role in cellular protection against oxidative stress and toxic foreign chemicals. They detoxify a variety of electrophilic compounds, including oxidized lipid, DNA and catechol products generated by reactive oxygen species-induced damage to intracellular molecules. An increasing number of GST genes are being recognized as polymorphic. Certain alleles, particularly those that confer impaired catalytic activity (e.g. \emph{GSTM1*0, GSTT1*0}), may be associated with increased sensitivity to toxic compounds. GST polymorphisms may be disease modifying; for example, in subgroups of patients with basal cell carcinoma or bronchial hyper-responsiveness, certain GST appear to exert a statistically significant and biologically relevant impact on disease susceptibility.},

Coastal ecosystems are important sources of carbon (primary production) to shelf waters and play a vital role in global nutrient cycling. These systems are especially vulnerable to the effects of human activities and will be the first areas impacted by rising sea levels. Within these coastal ecosystems, microalgal assemblages (microphytobenthos: MPB) are vital for autochthonous carbon fixation. The level of in situ production by MPB mediates the net carbon cycling of transitional ecosystems between net heterotrophic or autotrophic metabolism. In this study, we examine the interactive effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (370, 600, and 1000 ppmv), temperature (6°C, 12°C, and 18°C) and invertebrate biodiversity on MPB biomass in experimental systems. We assembled communities of three common grazing invertebrates (Hydrobia ulvae, Corophium volutator and Hediste diversicolor) in monoculture and in all possible multispecies combinations. This experimental design specifically addresses interactions between the selected climate change variables and any ecological consequences caused by changes in species composition or richness.},

  abstract = {Stressors associated with climate change and contaminants, resulting from the activities of humans, are affecting organisms and ecosystems globally. Previous studies suggest that the unique characteristics of polar biota, such as slower metabolisms and growth, and the generally stable conditions in their natural environment, cause higher susceptibility to contamination and climate change than those in temperate and tropical areas. We investigated the effects of increased temperature and decreased salinity on copper toxicity in four subantarctic marine invertebrates using realistic projected conditions under a future climatic change scenario for this region. We hypothesised that these relatively subtle shifts in environmental stressors would impact the sensitivity of cold-adapted species to copper. The four test species were: a copepod Harpacticus sp.; isopod Limnoria stephenseni; flatworm Obrimoposthia ohlini; and bivalve Gaimardia trapesina. These species occupy a range of ecological niches, spanning intertidal and subtidal nearshore zones. We predicted that species would differ in their tolerance to stressors, depending on where they occurred within this ecological gradient. Organisms were exposed to the multiple stressors in a factorial design in laboratory based toxicity tests. Sensitivity estimates for copper (LC50) were calculated using a novel statistical approach which directly assessed the impacts of the multiple stressors. In three of the four species tested, sensitivity to copper was amplified by small increases in temperature (2-4\,°C). The effects of salinity were more variable but a decrease of as little as 2\,ppt caused a significant effect in one species. This study provides some of the first evidence that high latitude species may be at increased risk from contaminants under projected future climate conditions. This interaction, between contaminants and the abiotic environment, highlights a potential pathway to biodiversity loss under a changing climate.},

  abstract = {Ensuring the health of aquatic ecosystems and identifying species at risk from the detrimental effects of environmental contaminants can be facilitated by integrating analytical chemical analysis with carefully selected biological endpoints measured in tissues of species of concern. These biological endpoints include molecular, biochemical, and physiological markers (i.e., biomarkers) that when integrated, can clarify issues of contaminant bioavailability, bioaccumulation, and ecological effects while enabling a better understanding of the effects of nonchemical stressors. In the case of contaminant stressors, an understanding of chemical modes of toxicity can be incorporated with diagnostic markers of aquatic animal physiology to help understand the health status of aquatic organisms in the field. Furthermore, new approaches in functional genomics and bioinformatics can help discriminate individual chemicals, or groups of chemicals among complex mixtures that may contribute to adverse biological effects. Although the use of biomarkers is not a new paradigm, such approaches have been underused in the context of ecological risk assessment and natural resource damage assessment. From a regulatory standpoint, these approaches can help better assess the complex effects from coastal development activities to assessing ecosystem integrity pre- and post development or site remediation.

  abstract = {The R package coin implements a unified approach to permutation tests providing a huge class of independence tests for nominal, ordered, numeric, and censored data as well as multivariate data at mixed scales. Based on a rich and flexible conceptual framework that embeds different permutation test procedures into a common theory, a computational framework is established in coin that likewise embeds the corresponding R functionality in a common S4 class structure with associated generic functions. As a consequence, the computational tools in coin inherit the flexibility of the underlying theory and conditional inference functions for important special cases can be set up easily.  Conditional versions of classical tests---such as tests for location and scale problems in two or more samples, independence in two- or three-way contingency tables, or association problems for censored, ordered categorical or multivariate data---can  easily be implemented as special cases using this computational  toolbox by choosing appropriate transformations of the observations. The paper gives a detailed exposition of both the internal structure of the package and the provided user interfaces along with examples on how to extend the implemented functionality.},

Zebrafish were exposed to two different doses (i.e., 0.5 and 5 mg L−1) of semi-static water with three individual compounds. Liver samples were collected on 7 and 14 days to analyze biochemical indicators, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), reduced glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Oxidative stress occurred in zebrafish liver with significantly changed indicators during the whole exposure period. Different experimental groups could induce or inhibit the activity of antioxidant enzymes with varying degrees. With a prolonged exposure time and increased exposure dose, the hepatic lipid peroxidation was also obviously observed. Moreover, the toxicity order of three organic UV filters was analyzed using the integrated biomarker response (IBR) index and the results indicate that exposure to PABA for 7 days at 0.5 mg L−1 and PBSA for 7 days at 5 mg L−1 induced the most severe oxidative stress in the liver of zebrafish.},

  abstract = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre—layout (or conventional) and layout—specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

  abstract = {The effect of three methods for spiking sediments with Cu on the reburial behavior, mortality, and tissue Cu accumulation of a lucinid bivalve (Indoaustriella lamprelli) and the influence of the bivalve on the sediment geochemistry were investigated. Methods used to create Cu concentration gradients were direct spiking with and without pH adjustment to pH 7 and also dilution of sediment, previously spiked with Cu and adjusted to pH 7, using a low-Cu sediment (known to produce the lowest pore-water Cu concentrations). The presence of the bivalve within Cu-spiked sediment increased the flux of Cu and Mn to overlying waters at high Cu concentrations (550 μg/g). Bivalve behavioral response, metal accumulation, and mortality varied with the method by which Cu was spiked. In direct Cu-spiked sediment, the bivalves were inactive at concentrations of 550 and 1,100 μg/g, with mortality induced in sediment spiked with 1,100 μg/g (pH 6.5-7.1). Complete bivalve inactivity was observed only at 1,100 μg/g in direct Cu-spiked sediment with pH adjustment, whereas percentage reburial was reduced to 30\% at 1,100 μg/g for sediment prepared by the dilution method. Relative reburial rates in the three spiked sediment types (direct « direct pH-7 {$<$} dilution) were proportional to dissolved Cu concentrations in the overlying water. Bivalve reburial, in addition to the method of Cu addition, affected tissue Cu accumulation. Inhibition of bivalve reburial decreased the amount of accumulated Cu, confounding relationships between tissue Cu and pore water, overlying water, or extractable metal fractions.},

No significant differences were observed for wet tissues of two species of fish. However, limited analysis of wet tissue of the amphipod, Leptocheirus plumulosus, indicated that the Bligh–Dyer gravimetric method generated higher lipid values, most likely due to the inclusion of non-lipid materials. Additionally, significant differences between the methods were observed with dry tissues, with the micro-colorimetric method consistently reporting calculated lipid values greater than as reported by the gravimetric method. This was most likely due to poor extraction of dry tissue in the standard Bligh–Dyer method, as no significant differences were found when analyzing a single composite extract. The data presented supports the conclusion that the micro-colorimetric method described in this paper is accurate, rapid, and minimizes time and solvent use.},

  abstract = {Heavy metal pollution is a worldwide problem, and cadmium (Cd) is one of the most noxious pollutants in aquatic environments. We studied P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and function in control and Cd exposed (50μgL−1 Cd, 30–40 days) oysters Crassostrea virginica as a possible mechanism of cell protection against Cd. Our data show that P-gp is expressed on cell membrane and in mitochondria of oyster gills and hepatopancreas. Inhibitor studies with verapamil, cyclosporine A and JS-2190 suggest that in the gills, mitochondrial P-gp pumps substrates from cytosol into the mitochondria, while cell membrane P-gp pumps substrates from cytosol out of the cell. Cd exposure resulted in a 2–2.5-fold increase in P-gp protein expression in cell membranes and a 3.5–7-fold increase in transport activity measured as the inhibitor-sensitive rhodamine B extrusion rate. In contrast, p-gp mRNA levels were similar in control and Cd-exposed oysters. No difference in P-gp protein expression was observed between mitochondria of control and Cd-exposed oysters but the apparent transport activity was higher in mitochondria from Cd-exposed oysters. Overall, a stronger increase in substrate transport activity in Cd-exposed oysters compared to a relatively weaker change in P-gp protein levels suggests that P-gp activity is post-translationally regulated. Our data show that direct determination of P-gp transport activity may be the best measure of the xenobiotic-resistant phenotype, whereas p-gp mRNA levels are not a good marker due to the likely involvement of multiple post-transcriptional regulatory steps. Cd exposure resulted in a significantly elevated rate of oxygen consumption of isolated oyster gills by 46\%. Specific inhibitors of ATPase function of P-gp (cyclosporine A and JS-2190) had no significant effect on tissue oxygen consumption indicating that P-gp contribution to energy budget is negligible and supporting indirect estimates based on the ATP stoichiometry of substrate transport that also suggest low energy demand for P-gp function.},

  abstract = {Estuarine and coastal habitats experience large fluctuations of environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) and pH; they also serve as the natural sinks for trace metals. Benthic filter-feeding organisms such as bivalves are exposed to the elevated concentrations of metals in estuarine water and sediments that can strongly affect their physiology. The effects of metals on estuarine organisms may be exacerbated by other environmental factors. Thus, a decrease in pH caused by high PCO2 (hypercapnia) can modulate the effects of trace metals by affecting metal bioavailability, accumulation or binding. To better understand the cellular mechanisms of interactions between PCO2 and trace metals in marine bivalves, we exposed isolated mantle cells of the hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) to different levels of PCO2 (0.05, 1.52 and 3.01kPa) and two major trace metal pollutants – cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu). Elevated PCO2 resulted in a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) of the isolated mantle cells from 7.8 to 7.4. Elevated PCO2 significantly but differently affected the trace metal accumulation by the cells. Cd uptake was suppressed at elevated PCO2 levels while Cu accumulation has greatly accelerated under hypercapnic conditions. Interestingly, at higher extracellular Cd levels, labile intracellular Cd2+ concentration remained the same, while intracellular levels of free Zn2+ increased suggesting that Cd2+ substitutes bound Zn2+ in these cells. In contrast, Cu exposure did not affect intracellular Zn2+ but led to a profound increase in the intracellular levels of labile Cu2+ and Fe2+. An increase in the extracellular concentrations of Cd and Cu led to the elevated production of reactive oxygen species under the normocapnic conditions (0.05kPa PCO2); surprisingly, this effect was mitigated in hypercapnia (1.52 and 3.01kPa). Overall, our data reveal complex and metal-specific interactions between the cellular effects of trace metals and PCO2 in clams and indicate that variations in environmental PCO2 may modulate the biological effects of trace metals in marine organisms.},

  abstract = {Intertidal bivalves experience broad fluctuations of environmental temperature, pH and oxygen content which could change their intracellular pH. They are also exposed to trace metals such as cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) that accumulate in their tissues and may negatively affect mitochondrial functions and bioenergetics. We determined the interactive effects of pH and trace metals (25μM Cd or Cu) on mitochondrial functions (including respiration and membrane potentials in both ADP-stimulated (state 3) and resting (state 4) states) of two common marine bivalves, the hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica). In the absence of the trace metals, mitochondrial functions of C. virginica and M. mercenaria were insensitive to pH in a broad physiologically relevant range (6.6–7.8). Mitochondrial respiration was generally suppressed by 25μM Cd or Cu (with the stronger effects observed for ADP-stimulated compared to the resting respiration) while the mitochondrial membrane potential was unaffected. pH modulated the effects of Cu and Cd on mitochondrial respiration of the bivalves. In oysters, Cu suppressed ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration at high and low pH values (6.6 and 7.8, respectively), but had no effect in the intermediate pH range (7.0–7.4). In clams, the negative effect of Cu on ADP-stimulated respiration was only observed at extremely high pH (7.8). A decrease in pH was also protective against Cd in mitochondria of clams and oysters. In clams, 25μM Cd suppressed ADP-stimulated respiration at all pH; however, at low pH (6.6–7.0) this suppression was paralleled by a decrease in the rates of proton leak thereby effectively restoring mitochondrial coupling. In oysters, the inhibitory effects of Cd on ADP-stimulated respiration were fully abolished at low pH (6.6–7.0). This indicates that moderate acidosis (such as occurs during exposure to air, extreme salinities or elevated CO2 levels in the intertidal zone) may have a beneficial side-effect of protecting mitochondria of clams and oysters against the toxic effects of trace metals in polluted estuaries.},

We studied the interactive effects of common metal pollutants (50μgl−1 Cd or Cu) and PCO2 (\textasciitilde 395, 800 and 2000μatm) on metal levels, intracellular pH, expression of metal binding proteins and stress biomarkers in estuarine bivalves Crassostrea virginica (oysters) and Mercenaria mercenaria (hard clams). Cd (but not Cu or hypercapnia) exposure affected the acid-base balance of hemocytes resulting in elevated intracellular pH. Cd and Cu exposure led to the increase in the tissue metal burdens, and metal accumulation was reduced by elevated PCO2 in the mantle but not hemocytes. No change was found in the intracellular free Cd2+, Cu2+ or Fe2+ during Cu or Cd exposure indicating that these metals are bound to intracellular ligands. Free Zn2+ content in oyster hemocytes was suppressed by Cd and Cu exposure and below the detection limits in clam hemocytes, which went hand-in-hand with the elevated mRNA expression of metallothioneins and ferritin in Cd- and Cu-exposed bivalves, enhanced by hypercapnia. The metal-binding and antioxidant mechanisms of oysters and clams were sufficient to effectively maintain intracellular redox status, even though metal exposure combined with moderate hypercapnia (\textasciitilde 800μatm PCO2) led to the elevated production of reactive oxygen species in hemocytes. Overall, while hypercapnia modulates metal accumulation, binding capacity and oxidative stress in estuarine bivalves, the physiological effects of elevated CO2 are mild compared to the effects of other common stressors.},

  abstract = {Estuarine organisms such as bivalves are commonly exposed to trace metals such as copper (Cu) and hypercapnia (elevated CO2 levels) in their habitats, which may affect their physiology and immune function. This study investigated the combined effects of elevated CO2 levels (∼800–2000~μatm PCO2, such as predicted by the near-future scenarios of global climate change) and Cu (50~μg~l−1) on immune functions of the sediment dwelling hard clams Mercenaria mercenaria and an epifaunal bivalve, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. Clams and oysters were exposed for 4 weeks to different CO2 and Cu levels, and tissue Cu burdens and immune parameters were assessed to test the hypothesis that hypercapnia will enhance Cu uptake due to the higher bioavailability of free Cu2+ and increase the immunomodulatory effects of Cu. Exposure to Cu stimulated key immune parameters of clams and oysters leading to increased number of circulating hemocytes, higher phagocytosis and adhesion ability of hemocytes, as well as enhanced antiparasitic and antibacterial properties of the hemolymph reflected in higher activities of lysozyme and inhibitors of cysteine proteases. Lysozyme activation by Cu exposure was most prominent in normocapnia (∼400~μatm PCO2) and an increase in the levels of the protease inhibitors was strongest in hypercapnia (∼800–2000~μatm PCO2), but other immunostimulatory effects of Cu were evident in all PCO2 exposures. Metabolic activity of hemocytes of clams and oysters (measured as routine and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates) was suppressed by Cu exposure likely reflecting lower rates of ATP synthesis and/or turnover. However, this metabolic suppression had no negative effects of the studied immune functions of hemocytes such as phagocytosis or adhesion capacity. Hypercapnia (∼800–2000~μatm PCO2) slightly but significantly enhanced accumulation of Cu in hemocytes, consistent with higher Cu2+ bioavailability in CO2-acidified water, but had little effect on cellular and humoral immune traits of clams and oysters. These findings indicate that low levels of Cu contamination may enhance immunity of estuarine bivalves while moderate hypercapnia (such as predicted by the near future scenarios of the global climate change) does not strongly affect their immune parameters.},

  abstract = {Along with the phase-out of legacy long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and their precursors, attention has been drawn to emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). This study is aimed at investigating the importance of selected emerging PFASs as pollutants in European coastal environments and a possible transition from legacy long-chain PFCAs and PFSAs to replacement compounds. Therefore, the spatial distribution of 29 PFASs was analysed in surface water and sediment of the North and Baltic Seas sampled in 2017. Levels of the replacement compound HFPO-DA were approximately three times higher than those of its predecessor PFOA in surface water from the North Sea, which is characterised by the influence of point sources and constant exchange with open water. Reanalysis of sample extracts from the last decade showed that HFPO-DA had already been present in 2011, when it had not yet been in focus. In the Baltic Sea with a limited water exchange and dominance of diffuse sources, the proportion of HFPO-DA was negligible, whereas long-chain PFCAs and PFSAs still contributed to ∑PFASs with about 30\%. The emerging cyclic compound perfluoro-4-ethylcyclohexanesulfonate (PFECHS), which has not yet been reported in European coastal environments, was detected in 86\% of the Baltic Sea samples. Influenced by sediment characteristics in addition to source-specific contributions, the spatial distribution of PFASs in surface sediments was more variable than for water samples. The linear isomer of the long-chain legacy substance PFOS was the predominant compound found over the entire study area. Of the emerging PFASs, 6:6 and 6:8 perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids (PFPiAs) were identified close to potential industrial inputs and in sedimentation areas. The results show that particular emerging PFASs play a relevant role in the investigated coastal environments and that a shift to replacements is dependent on sources and geographical conditions.},

  abstract = {Biodynamic parameters of the ragworm Nereis diversicolor from southern Spain and south England were experimentally derived to assess the inter-population variability of physiological parameters of the bioaccumulation of Ag, Cd and Zn from water and sediment. Although there were some limited variations, these were not consistent with the local metal bioavailability nor with temperature changes. Incorporating the biodynamic parameters into a defined biodynamic model, confirmed that sediment is the predominant source of Cd and Zn accumulated by the worms, accounting in each case for 99\% of the overall accumulated metals, whereas the contribution of dissolved Ag to the total accumulated by the worm increased from about 27 to about 53\% with increasing dissolved Ag concentration. Standardised values of metal-specific parameters were chosen to generate a generalised model to be extended to N. diversicolor populations across a wide geographical range from western Europe to North Africa. According to the assumptions of this model, predicted steady state concentrations of Cd and Zn in N. diversicolor were overestimated, those of Ag underestimated, but still comparable to independent field measurements. We conclude that species-specific physiological metal bioaccumulation parameters are relatively constant over large geographical distances, and a single generalised biodynamic model does have potential to predict accumulated Ag, Cd and Zn concentrations in this polychaete from a single sediment metal concentration.},

It also assessed possible/likely interactive impacts (combined impacts of climate change stressors and pollutants) on pollutants mobilization, pollutants toxicity (effects on growth, reproduction, mortality) and pollutants bioaccumulation in estuarine and marine biota. An increase in temperature and extreme events may enhance the release, degradation, transportation, and mobilization of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pollutants in the estuarine and marine environments. Based on the available pollutants' toxicity trend data and information it reveals that the toxicity of several high-risk pollutants may increase with increasing levels of climate change stressors. It is likely that the interactive effects of climate change and pollutants may enhance the bioaccumulation of pollutants in seafood organisms. There is a paucity of literature relating to realistic interactive effects of climate change and pollutants. Therefore, future research should be directed towards the combined effects of climate change stressors and pollutants on estuarine and marine bota. A sustainable solution for pollution control caused by both greenhouse gas emissions (that cause climate change) and chemical pollutants would be required to safeguard the estuarine and marine biota.},

First, on a time scale relevant to climate change, many other factors influencing estuaries will also change. These include human population, water withdrawals, discharge of sediments and substances, harvest, and species introductions. Changes in climate and these more direct anthropogenic drivers affect estuaries mainly through their joint influences on freshwater flow, sediment budgets, alteration of vegetated beds, eutrophication, and shifts in species composition or distribution. Second, estuaries are heterogeneous, ranging from tiny coastal salt marshes to huge marine bays and river deltas, and from remote locations to the harbors of the world's coastal cities. Regional and local differences in trends of climate and human activities ensure great variation among these systems in their long-term trajectories. Third, because estuaries are connected to both sea and land, they are among the most complex, variable ecosystems on earth, and their responses to myriad changes in external influences are unlikely to simply be related to temperature or other climate conditions. Generalizations about the long-term trajectories of estuaries are unwarranted without consideration of regional to local differences in forcing and responses.},

Whole-sediment tests used copper- (1300mg/kg) and zinc- (4000mg/kg) spiked sediments after equilibration for sufficient time to produce pore water and overlying water concentrations below the lowest observable effect concentrations of water-only exposures. Survival of adults (after 10d) and juveniles (after 96h), and the metal concentrations in the body tissues of adults, were determined at the end of the tests. Two epibenthic amphipods from the genus Melita were the most sensitive species to aqueous copper and zinc, with a 96-h LC50 value of 120μgCu/l for both M. awa and M. plumulosa juveniles, and a 96-h LC50 value of 640μgZn/l for juveniles of M. plumulosa. Juvenile amphipods (7-d old) were more sensitive than adult amphipods ({$>$}30-d old) in both water-only and whole-sediment tests, with adult-LC50/juvenile-LC50 ratios in water-only tests ranging from 1.2 to l.5 for copper and 1 to 1.4 for zinc. All species except C. colo, C. cf. lucasi and M. matilda were sensitive to the copper-spiked sediment, with survival between 14\% and 74\% of controls. Similarly, all species except C. colo and G. japonica, showed a response to the zinc-spiked sediment (26–81\% of control survival).

  abstract = {Projections of climate-induced changes in temperature and precipitation let expect also altered frequencies and intensities of extreme hydrological events such as floods or prolonged periods of low river discharges. Particularly such extremes may, moreover, lead to modified inputs of particulate matter into rivers and estuaries, and may thus affect the quality of estuarine sediments. This study focuses on the assessment of potential climate-induced changes of particle-bound contaminant concentrations in the estuaries of the rivers Elbe, Ems and Weser and the resulting challenges for sediment management in the navigable waterways there. The estimation of climate-induced changes of contaminant concentrations in estuarine particulate matter (PM) was based on results of projections on the fluvial PM input into the Elbe estuary in the near (2021–2050) and far future (2071–2100) and on assumed extreme changes of such inputs. A mixing model using the concentrations of selected contaminants as indicators for marine and fluvial PM was applied. Distinct changes of contaminant concentrations were found only for the far future and with the assumed extreme PM inputs in the inner Elbe estuary. And only for the inner Elbe estuary the worst-case scenario indicated that concentrations of some organochlorine contaminants in the far future exceed the national assessment criteria for the handling of dredged material within coastal waterways more distinct than today. Therefore, adaptations of practices for the management of dredged material to higher particulate matter contaminations should be considered there in the medium or long-term perspective.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 1419–1434 Abstract Ocean acidification is a pervasive stressor that could affect many marine organisms and cause profound ecological shifts. A variety of biological responses to ocean acidification have been measured across a range of taxa, but this information exists as case studies and has not been synthesized into meaningful comparisons amongst response variables and functional groups. We used meta-analytic techniques to explore the biological responses to ocean acidification, and found negative effects on survival, calcification, growth and reproduction. However, there was significant variation in the sensitivity of marine organisms. Calcifying organisms generally exhibited larger negative responses than non-calcifying organisms across numerous response variables, with the exception of crustaceans, which calcify but were not negatively affected. Calcification responses varied significantly amongst organisms using different mineral forms of calcium carbonate. Organisms using one of the more soluble forms of calcium carbonate (high-magnesium calcite) can be more resilient to ocean acidification than less soluble forms (calcite and aragonite). Additionally, there was variation in the sensitivities of different developmental stages, but this variation was dependent on the taxonomic group. Our analyses suggest that the biological effects of ocean acidification are generally large and negative, but the variation in sensitivity amongst organisms has important implications for ecosystem responses.},

  abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) filter compounds are the key constituents in sunscreens that protect human skin from detrimental solar radiation. Some of these products have attracted public attention due to claims of their potential negative impact on the environment, in particular marine fauna and flora. At present, consumers who want to make an eco-conscious decision cannot find suitable product details and need to rely on fragmented information or complex scientific literature. The same is true for sunscreen developers, typically formulation chemists, who at present can only work with black- and whitelists which recommend or omit compounds. The ecological impact evaluation system proposed in this publication makes it easier to choose UV filters. Selection is based intrinsically on specialized knowledge which is built on environmental safety data. By embedding this in an existing in-silico sunscreen design system, new products can be created during the project’s design phase without time and cost intensive investigations. In contrast to currently available methods, the proposed tool includes comparison with a virtual market benchmark so users can determine whether a newly developed product will be an improvement on the state of the art in terms of environmental compatibility. The level of improvement can be displayed as a logo which has been designed to be immediately understandable to consumers. The system can be re-adjusted in regular time frames, depending on market development, to motivate and drive the sunscreen industry towards more eco-compatible products.},

  abstract = {Large programs in chemical oceanography currently require the determination of multiple trace elements in hundreds to thousands of open ocean seawater samples. For example, the international GEOTRACES program would benefit greatly from rapid, precise, automated, multi-element analytical methods for multiple trace metals in seawater. An automated, on-line extraction, flow-injection ICP-MS method is presented here for simultaneous determination of Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn in open ocean seawater samples. A fully automated commercially available system buffers the pH of the samples on-line and extracts the metals of interest from 9mL of seawater onto a chelation resin column, which is then eluted (1.6M HNO3) directly into a magnetic sector ICP-MS. The resulting transient peaks elute in 45μL (\textasciitilde 30s) yielding a preconcentration factor of \textasciitilde 200, and the total analysis cycle requires 8.75min per sample. Elemental concentrations are calculated from integrated peak areas using a combination of isotope dilution and matrix-matched standard curves. Procedural blanks determined at periodic intervals (every 10 samples) throughout each sample run are used for blank correction and for calculating detection limits (range 0.3 to 16pmolkg−1 seawater for these elements). Replicate analyses of a Ross Sea in-house consistency standard and four GEOTRACES reference seawater materials (Atlantic and Pacific, surface and deep water) are used to demonstrate precision of 1–3\% (RSD) and very good agreement with reference consensus values for all elements except Co. Determined Co concentrations are \textasciitilde 40\% lower than consensus values, consistent with the presence of strong Co ligands in seawater, and the absence of a UV-oxidation step in this method. As illustrated by oceanographically consistent profiles at the GEOTRACES Atlantic and Pacific baseline stations, this method provides highly precise measurement of trace metals over the full range of concentrations occurring in the global ocean. Moreover, the full methodology, including flow-injection hardware and control software, is readily transferable to other users.},

  abstract = {Antifouling paints are biocidal products applied to ship and boat hulls in order to prevent the growth and settlement of marine organisms, i.e. fouling. The release of biocides from the surface of the paint film act to repel or poison potential settling organisms. Currently, the most commonly used biocide in antifouling paints is cuprous oxide. In the EU, antifouling products are regulated under the Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR), which states that the recommended dose should be the minimum necessary to achieve the desired effect. For antifouling products, the dose is measured as the release rate of biocide(s) from coating. In this study, the release rates of copper and zinc from eight different coatings for leisure boats were determined through static exposure of coated panels in four different harbors located in Swedish waters along a salinity gradient ranging from 0 to 27 PSU. The results showed the release rate of copper to increase with increasing salinity. Paints with a higher content of cuprous oxide were also found to release larger amounts of copper. The coatings’ ability to prevent biofouling was also evaluated and no significant difference in efficacy between the eight tested products was observed at the brackish and marine sites. Hence, the products with high release rates of copper were equally efficient as those with 4 – 6 times lower releases. These findings suggest that current antifouling paints on the market are leaching copper in excess of the effective dose in brackish and marine waters. Additionally, the results from the freshwater site showed no benefit in applying a copper-containing paint for the purpose of fouling prevention. This indicates that the use of biocidal paints in freshwater bodies potentially results in an unnecessary release of copper. By reducing the release rates of copper from antifouling paints in marine waters and restricting the use of biocidal paints in freshwater, the load of copper to the environment could be substantially reduced.},

For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

Both increasing temperature and Cd exposure led to a rise in standard metabolic rates, and combined stressors appeared to override the capability for aerobic energy production resulting in impaired stress tolerance. Oysters exposed to elevated temperature but not Cd showed no significant change in condition, survival rate and lipid peroxidation, whereas those exposed to both Cd and temperature stress suffered high mortality accompanied by low condition index and elevated lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, RNA/DNA ratios indicative of protein synthesis rate, and levels of glutathione, which is involved in metal detoxification, increased in Cd-exposed oysters at 20°C but not at 28°C. Implications of the synergism between elevated temperatures and cadmium stress on energy metabolism of oysters are discussed in the light of the potential effects of climate change on oyster populations in polluted areas.},

The investigation included an upstream gradient, westwards through Lake Mälaren (46km), and a downstream gradient, eastwards through the Stockholm archipelago (84km). The results indicated a severe pollution situation in central Stockholm, with poor health status of the perch: retarded growth, increased frequency of sexually immature females, low gonadosomatic index, and disturbed visceral fat metabolism. ∑DDT, measured as a pollution indicator, was 10–28 times higher than the background in perch from the Baltic Proper. Besides the main gradient other sources of pollution also influenced the response pattern of the measured biomarkers. In particular, there were strong indications of pollution coming from the Baltic Sea.},

  abstract = {Noncausal associations between exposures and outcomes are a threat to validity of causal inference in observational studies. Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biologic laboratory experiments—the use of “negative controls”—is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},

Grain size and provenance are the two most significant parameters which must be compensated for by any normalization procedure. The various granulometric and geochemical approaches used for the normalization of heavy-metal data from estuarine and coastal sediments are reviewed in this paper. Overall, geochemical normalization appears to be superior to granulometric methods because it compensates for the mineralogical as well as the natural granular variability of trace-metal concentrations in sediments. Detailed examination of heavy metal, aluminium (Al), and lithium (Li) concentrations indicates that Li is superior to Al for the normalization of the metal data from sediments derived mainly from glacial erosion of crystalline rocks. Lithium is of equal merit, or superior to Al, for the normalization of metal data from most other silicate sediments. Lithium normalization provides an alternative procedure to those used previously for the identification and estimation of relative anthropogenic trace-metal contributions to estuarine and coastal sediments.},

An overview of the toxic effects of nano-TiO2 on human and environmental health is provided. A meta-analysis is conducted to analyze the toxicity of nano-TiO2 to the liver, circulatory system, and DNA in humans. To assess the environmental impacts of nano-TiO2, aquatic environments that receive high nano-TiO2 inputs are focused on, and the toxicity of nano-TiO2 to aquatic organisms is discussed with regard to the present and predicted environmental concentrations. Genotoxicity, damage to membranes, inflammation and oxidative stress emerge as the main mechanisms of nano-TiO2 toxicity. Furthermore, nano-TiO2 can bind with free radicals and signal molecules, and interfere with the biochemical reactions on plasmalemma. At the higher organizational level, nano-TiO2 toxicity is manifested as the negative effects on fitness-related organismal traits including feeding, reproduction and immunity in aquatic organisms. Bibliometric analysis reveals two major research hot spots including the molecular mechanisms of toxicity of nano-TiO2 and the combined effects of nano-TiO2 and other environmental factors such as light and pH. The possible measures to reduce the harmful effects of nano-TiO2 on humans and non-target organisms has emerged as an underexplored topic requiring further investigation.},

Biologically available Cd and Co in solution contribute significantly to Cd and Co concentrations in both Scrobicularia and Nereis.

  abstract = {Water pollution may be a serious environmental problem for Lake Hawassa, an important fishing and recreational site as well as a drinking-water source in Ethiopia. The present study aims at determining the distribution of metals and metalloids in the lake's water, sediment and fish tissues and assessing the resulting human health and ecological risks. Metals were detected in both abiotic and biotic samples. In water, only the Hg concentration was significantly different among sampling sites. The average concentration of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in water were below the environmental quality thresholds, thus not having potentially adverse effect on aquatic life. In sediment, significant differences in metals concentration among sites were found for As, Cd, Pb, Co, Zn and Hg (p {$<$} 0.05). Exceedances of As, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni and Zn were found in sediment, with Cr, Ni and Zn above the probable effect concentration and being potentially toxic to aquatic life. Fish stored more metals in their liver than in their muscle. The concentration of metals in carnivorous fish (Barbus intermedius) was not higher in muscle and liver than those in herbivores fish (Oreochromis niloticus). The Bioaccumulation Factor of Cr in all fish species muscle was {$>$}1. The Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factor of all metals in all fish species muscle were {$<$}1. Positive correlations among metals in water and correlations among metals in sediment were found, indicating a potential common pollution source. Positive correlation of total organic carbon with Cd, Co and Se and clay content with Pb, As and Hg was found and may imply that metals are easily adsorbed by the organic matter and fine sediment. With respect to the measured metals no potential health risk due to consumption of fish from Lake Hawassa was observed. The H-02 free water surface constructed wetland has been applied to remove heavy metals, mainly copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), from wastewater on the Savannah River Site (Aiken, SC, USA). More and more studies focus on the metal behavior between the sediment and the overlying water, which directly reflects the stability of metals after sedimentation in constructed wetlands. This study focused on the biogeochemical pathways in metal bioavailability and remobilization in the sediment after metals were removed from the overlying water. The dialysis sampling device (peeper) was used to collect porewater samples from eight depths in the sediment for the measurement of Cu, Zn, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and major anions (sulfate and chloride). Surface water samples were also collected for the measurement of Cu, Zn, DOC, and anions. Different temporal trends were observed for dissolved Cu between the surface and bottom waters, but not for dissolved Zn. There were no obvious changes in porewater metal concentrations with increasing depths in the sediment. Sediment served as a sink for Cu as only 3\% of porewater samples showed higher labile Cu concentrations than the surface water during the entire year, and these samples were collected below the sediment-water interface. However, sediment served as a source for Zn in summer and winter as 32\% of porewater samples showed higher labile Zn concentrations than the surface water, and these samples were collected at all sediment depths. We think the seasonal changes in the behaviors of Cu and Zn are primarily controlled by the sulfur dynamics and the metal removal processes in the constructed wetland, as well as the different complexing chemistry between Cu and Zn. Also, our study supports that peeper is a powerful tool for studying the biogeochemistry of metals in the sediment. Mining has been described as an important source of contaminants to the coastal zone worldwide, which is greatly intensified in the case of tailing dam ruptures. This study assessed the environmental quality of the marine coastal area impacted by a mining disaster (Fundão Mine dam collapse on 05 November 2015, Southeast Brazil) by applying a geochemical multi-index and physical approach over 18 months (from October 2018 to March 2020). Nutrients, metal(oid)s and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) were integrated by quality indexes: Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CWQI) and the Pollution Load Index (PLI) for water quality; Sediment Quality Guideline Quotients (SQG-q metal(oid)s and SQG-q PAHs) for sediment quality. Three scenarios regarding river discharge and wave-heights (Hs) were considered: 2018/2019-wet, 2019-dry, 2019/2020-wet. An Environmental Risk Assessment framework was built to describe the overall environmental quality in regards to water and sediment quality indexes as well as physical conditions. Here we show that the worsening of environmental quality is highly associated with the decrease of water quality by metal(oid)s (total forms of As and Ni; dissolved forms of Co and Fe) during the 2019-dry scenario when river discharge was at the lowest and the highest Hs occurred. Resuspension of fine sediment and suspended Fe(III) oxy-hydroxide nanoparticles by waves seem to be the main processes for releasing metal(oid)s into the water column. CWQI and PLI showed marginal and polluted conditions for water quality, respectively, and SQG-q for metals and PAHs indicated moderate impact in the sediment during the 2019-dry period. Toxicity to pelagic and benthic fauna is expected to occur in those conditions. Recovery of environmental quality occurred during the 2019/2020-wet scenario, which could be explained by alongshore and offshore transport of sediment and the dilution of aqueous metal(oid)s by intense river discharge on the continental shelf. Levels of trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Mn, and Zn) were measured in soft tissues and external tubes of the Mediterranean fanworm, Sabella spallanzanii (Gmelin, 1791), to evaluate its suitability as a biomonitor of metal pollution. Study was conducted in the coastal area of the eastern Adriatic Sea. Polychaetes were collected from two locations, a site located in a local marina and an unpolluted control site. Results indicate that S. spallanzanii has the capacity to accumulate metals in soft tissues as well as in tubes. The levels of most metals were considerably higher in tubes compared to soft tissues, indicating long-term accumulation of metals in tubes. High levels of several metals (Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb and Fe), found in soft tissues and tubes sampled at the marina site, reflect the elevated contaminant levels in the marina, associated with the use of antifouling agents, paints, petrol additives, and ship maintenance activities. Metal concentrations in tissues and tubes generally decreased with size, indicating the influence of growth and metabolic rates on trace metal uptake. Trace metal levels found in S. spallanzanii tissues were comparable to the levels found in Mytilus galloprovincialis, a species commonly used in biomonitoring studies, in areas exposed to similar levels of anthropogenic stressors. According to the results of the present study, S. spallanzanii has been identified as a suitable biomonitor of metal pollution due to its sedentary nature, widespread distribution, abundance and the ability to accumulate high levels of metals within its tissues and tubes. The A-01 wetland treatment system (WTS) was designed to remove metals (primarily copper) from the effluent at the A-01 National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) outfall at the Savannah River Site, Aiken, SC. This research investigated metal removal, distribution and retention in the A-01 WTS over a period of 20 years. The findings are important for ensuring continued metal sequestration in the A-01 WTSs over time, providing management guidance for constructed wetlands, and investigating changes in metal remediation effectiveness as a wetland ages. During 20 years of operation, systematic water and sediment sampling validated the wetlands' performance. After passage through the treatment cells, Cu concentrations were well below permit limits during all years of operation, often falling below 10 μg L−1. Cu removal has been consistent over time, averaging about 80\% despite large changes in influent Cu concentrations. Most divalent metals were rapidly removed from the water and held in the sediments shortly after the water entered the treatment wetland. Average removal of Pb from water by the wetland system was 67 and 74\% in 2004 and 2020, respectively. Comparable values for Zn were 52 and 65\%, respectively. Generally, the highest concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn were found in the sediment from the first cell in each pair of cells suggesting that most of the Cu, Pb, and Zn in the A-01 effluent was bound to the sediment quickly. Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) measurements of Cu and Zn in the sediments were much lower than bulk sediment concentrations. These results suggest that most of the Cu and Zn in the A-01 WTS sediments was not bioavailable, hence not toxic to aquatic organisms, as a likely consequence of adsorption to sediment particles and complexation with organic and inorganic substances. Chemical pollution is a major environmental concern especially in coastal areas, having adverse impacts on marine organisms and ecosystem services. Macroalgae can accumulate trace elements, but available studies are restricted to a limited number of elements and species. The goal of this research was to assess, seasonally, the concentrations of 22 elements in the brown alga Padina pavonica from monitoring sampling sites in Slovenian waters. The concentration of most elements in thalli differed significantly between spring and autumn, with generally higher levels in autumn samples. However, it was not possible to correlate these concentrations with the ecological status of macroalgae. The maximum values set by European regulations for the potentially hazardous As, Cd and Hg in food and feed were never exceeded, while Pb concentrations were slightly higher. The results show that P. pavonica can act as an effective bioindicator of chemical pollution.},

  abstract = {Multiple stressors are continuously deteriorating surface waters worldwide, posing many challenges for their conservation and restoration. Combined effect types of multiple stressors range from single-stressor dominance to complex interactions. Identifying prevalent combined effect types is critical for environmental management, as it helps to prioritise key stressors for mitigation. However, it remains unclear whether observed single and combined stressor effects reflect true ecological processes unbiased by sample size and length of stressor gradients. Therefore, we examined the role of sample size and stressor gradient lengths in 158 paired-stressor response cases with over 120,000 samples from rivers, lakes, transitional and marine ecosystems around the world. For each case, we split the overall stressor gradient into two partial gradients (lower and upper) and investigated associated changes in single and combined stressor effects. Sample size influenced the identified combined effect types, and stressor interactions were less likely for cases with fewer samples. After splitting gradients, 40 \% of cases showed a change in combined effect type, 30 \% no change, and 31 \% showed a loss in stressor effects. These findings suggest that identified combined effect types may often be statistical artefacts rather than representing ecological processes. In 58 \% of cases, we observed changes in stressor effect directions after the gradient split, suggesting unimodal stressor effects. In general, such non-linear responses were more pronounced for organisms at higher trophic levels. We conclude that observed multiple stressor effects are not solely determined by ecological processes, but also strongly depend on sampling design. Observed effects are likely to change when sample size and/or gradient length are modified. Our study highlights the need for improved monitoring programmes with sufficient sample size and stressor gradient coverage. Our findings emphasize the importance of adaptive management, as stress reduction measures or further ecosystem degradation may change multiple stressor-effect relationships, which will then require associated changes in management strategies.},

  abstract = {The influence of increasing temperatures in thermal and oxidative stress responses were studied in the muscle of several estuarine fish species (Diplodus vulgaris, Diplodus sargus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Gobius niger and Liza ramada). Selected fish were collected in July at the Tagus estuary (24±0.9°C; salinity of 30±4‰; pH=8). Fish were subjected to a temperature increase of 1°C.h−1 until they reached their Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax), starting at 24°C (control temperature). Muscle samples were collected during the trial and results showed that oxidative stress biomarkers are highly sensitive to temperature. Results from stress oxidative enzymes show alterations with increasing temperature in all tested species. Catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6) activity significantly increased in L. ramada, D. labrax and decreased in D. vulgaris. Glutathione S-transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) activity increased in L. ramada, D. sargus, D. vulgaris, and D. labrax. In G. niger it showed a cycle of increase-decrease. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) increased in L. ramada, D. sargus and D. labrax. With respect to correlation analysis (Pearson; Spearman r), the results showed that oxidation products and antioxidant defenses were correlated in L. ramada (LPO-CAT and LPO-GST, D. sargus (LPO-CAT), and D. labrax (LPO-CAT). Oxidative biomarkers were correlated with thermal stress biomarker (Hsp70) in L. ramada (CAT-Hsp70), D. vulgaris (LPO-Hsp70), D. labrax (GST-Hsp70) and G. niger (LPO-Hsp70). In conclusion, oxidative stress does occur with increasing temperatures and there seems to be a relation between thermal stress response and oxidative stress response. The results suggest that oxidative stress biomarkers should be applied with caution, particularly in field multi-species/multi-environment studies.},

  abstract = {Estuarine systems are critical transition zones influenced by sea, land and freshwater. An array of human activities impacts these areas leading to multiple-stressor interactions. Temperature and salinity are among the most relevant drivers in estuaries, shaping species growth, reproduction and distribution. However, few studies provide an overview of cellular rewiring processes under multiple-stressor environments. Here, we tested how salinity could shape the response of ragworms Hediste diversicolor, an important bioindicator and commercial species, to elevated temperature. We exposed polychaetes to three temperatures for a month, simulating control, ocean warming and heatwave conditions (24, 27 and 30 °C, respectively) combined with two salinities (20 and 30). We quantified whole-organism performance (wet weight gain and survival), along with cellular stress response (CSR) and energy reserves of worms after 14 and 28 days of exposure. Significant three-way interactions between temperature, salinity and exposure time show the non-linearity of molecular responses. Worms at a salinity of 20 were more sensitive to warming than worms exposed to a salinity of 30. The combination of high temperature and low salinity can act synergistically to induce oxidative stress and macromolecular damage in worm tissues. This finding was supported by an induction of the CSR, with a concomitant decrease of energy reserves, pointing towards a metabolic compensation strategy. However, under a higher salinity (30), the need for a CSR upon thermal challenge was reduced and energy content increased with temperature, which suggests that environmental conditions were within the optimum range. Heatwaves striking low-salinity areas of estuaries can therefore negatively impact the cellular physiology of H. diversicolor, with greater metabolic costs. However, extreme stress levels were not reached as worms incremented wet weight and survival was high under all conditions tested. Our findings are important for the optimization of ragworm aquaculture and adaptive conservation strategies of estuarine systems.},

A statistic \$U\$ depending on the relative ranks of the \$x\$'s and \$y\$'s is proposed for testing the hypothesis \$f = g\$. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis \$f = g\$ the probability of obtaining a given \$U\$ in a sample of \$n x's\$ and \$m y's\$ is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving \$n\$ and \$m\$. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of \$U\$ for samples up to \$n = m = 8\$. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if \$m, n\$ go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives \$f(x) {$>$} g(x)\$ for every \$x\$.},

Sublethal responses were determined in the sea-worms after 14-days of exposure to sediment spiked with some of the most representative pharmaceutical products found in the environment: carbamazepine (CBZ), ibuprofen (IBP), fluoxetine (FX), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and propranolol (PRO), including the environmental concentrations. Phases I (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase – EROD and dibenzylfluorescein dealkylase – DBF) and II (glutathione S-transferase – GST) of the metabolism, antioxidant system (glutathione peroxidase – GPX and glutathione reductase – GR), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase – AChE) and oxidative effects (lipid peroxidation – LPO and DNA damage strand breaks) were selected to evaluate the sublethal responses in the sea-worms. FX, EE2 and PRO were detoxified by the phase I of the metabolism (EROD activity). On the other hand, phase II (GST-activity) did not respond in sea-worms exposed to pharmaceutical products, except for the environmental concentrations of CBZ (activation) and PRO (deactivation). Neurotoxicity was induced in sea-worms exposed to EE2 (only the environmental concentrations), FX, IBP and CBZ. Oxidative effect determined as LPO increased in sea-worms exposed to environmental concentrations of IBP, EE2 and PRO. Genetic damage increased in sea-worms exposed to IBP and diminished for FX, EE2 and PRO.

After the exposure, cellular energy status (total lipids content – TLP; and mitochondrial electron transport activity – MET), metabolism of monoamines (monoamine oxidase activity – MAO) and inflammation properties (cyclooxygenase activity – COX) were observed in polychaetes. CBZ increased TLP content and MET activity, and decreased MAO activity in polychaetes. IBP did not interfere on the TLP level, but on the MET and MAO activities (environmental concentrations). FX did not cause changes in the energy status. Therefore, environmental concentration diminished MAO activity. EE2 did not affect the energy status, however, MAO activity was significantly lower in polychaetes exposed to environmental concentration. PRO increased TLP level in polychaetes, but not MET activity. MAO activity was significantly lower for polychaetes exposed to environmental concentration. Except FX, all pharmaceuticals showed anti-inflammatory properties confirmed by the decrease of COX activity. Pharmaceutical products affected H. diversicolor physiology and health.

  abstract = {The nutritional essentiality of zinc for the growth of living organisms had been recognized long before zinc biochemistry began with the discovery of zinc in carbonic anhydrase in 1939. Painstaking analytical work then demonstrated the presence of zinc as a catalytic and structural cofactor in a few hundred enzymes. In the 1980s, the field again gained momentum with the new principle of “zinc finger” proteins, in which zinc has structural functions in domains that interact with other biomolecules. Advances in structural biology and a rapid increase in the availability of gene/protein databases now made it possible to predict zinc-binding sites from metal-binding motifs detected in sequences. This procedure resulted in the definition of zinc proteomes and the remarkable estimate that the human genome encodes ∼3000 zinc proteins. More recent developments focus on the regulatory functions of zinc(II) ions in intra- and intercellular information transfer and have tantalizing implications for yet additional functions of zinc in signal transduction and cellular control. At least three dozen proteins homeostatically control the vesicular storage and subcellular distribution of zinc and the concentrations of zinc(II) ions. Novel principles emerge from quantitative investigations on how strongly zinc interacts with proteins and how it is buffered to control the remarkably low cellular and subcellular concentrations of free zinc(II) ions. It is fair to conclude that the impact of zinc for health and disease will be at least as far-reaching as that of iron.},

The optimal weight for averaging a set of independent effect sizes is the inverse variance of each effect size, but in practice these weights have to be estimated, being affected by sampling error. When assuming a random-effects model, there are two alternative procedures for averaging independent effect sizes: Hunter and Schmidt’s estimator, which consists of weighting by sample size as an approximation to the optimal weights; and Hedges and Vevea’s estimator, which consists of weighting by an estimation of the inverse variance of each effect size. In this article, the bias and mean squared error of the two estimators were assessed via Monte Carlo simulation of meta-analyses with the standardized mean difference as the effect-size index. Hedges and Vevea’s estimator, although slightly biased, achieved the best performance in terms of the mean squared error. As the differences between the values of both estimators could be of practical relevance, Hedges and Vevea’s estimator should be selected rather than that of Hunter and Schmidt when the effect-size index is the standardized mean difference.},

Stress on Stress (SoS) and lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) biomarkers were analysed in resident mussels (Mytilus sp.) from 8 coastal sites and in transplanted mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from two Spanish Mediterranean coastal sites. The assessment of results, as input to pollution monitoring strategies, was performed jointly for LMS and SoS data from the two regions. Contaminant body burden of the mussels was compared with biomarker results. The results demonstrated that these two general and non-expensive stress biomarkers in mussel can be applied throughout European waters, providing a cost-effective and harmonised approach to screen contaminant-related biological effects within the framework of wide-scale pollution biomonitoring programmes, such as that proposed by the European Union, i.e. the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

In this study, the combined effects of thermal stress and exposure to gadolinium (Gd), a metal used as a contrasting agent in medical imaging which enters the aquatic environment, were investigated in the embryos and larvae of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Embryos were exposed to six treatments of three temperatures (18 °C, 21 °C, 24 °C) and two Gd concentrations (control: 0 μM; treated: 20 μM). With respect to developmental progression, increased temperature accelerated development and achievement of the larval stage, while Gd-exposed embryos at the control temperature (18 °C) showed a general delay in development at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf), and a stunting effect and impaired skeleton growth at 48 hpf. Elevated temperatures at near-future projections (+3 °C, 21 °C) reduced the negative effects of Gd on development with a lower percentage of abnormality and improved skeleton growth. Combined extreme warming at present-day marine heatwave conditions (+6 °C, 24 °C) and Gd treatment resulted in a lower proportion of embryos reaching the advanced larval stages compared to the 21 °C + Gd. At the molecular level, western blot analysis showed that Gd was the main driver for the induction of heat shock protein (HSP60, HSP70) expression. At 48 hpf, temperature increase was the main driver for activation of additional cellular stress response strategies such as autophagy and apoptosis. Combined treatments showed the induction of HSP60 at 24 hpf and autophagic and apoptotic processes at 48 hpf. Treatments having low levels of HSPs expression showed high levels of apoptosis, and vice versa, clearly demonstrating the antagonistic effects of HSPs expression and apoptosis. Detection of fragmented DNA in apoptotic nuclei showed selective apoptosis, likely in extremely damaged cells. Our results indicate that the negative effects of Gd-exposure on P. lividus larval development and biomineralization will be mitigated by a near-future ocean warming, up to a thermotolerance threshold when negative synergistic effects were evident. Our data highlight the use of biomarkers as sensitive tools to detect environmental impacts as well as the need for a better understanding of the interactions between the multiple stressors faced by marine species in coastal environments.},

  abstract = {Among many colorimetric methods for carbohydrate analysis, the phenol–sulfuric acid method is the easiest and most reliable method. It has been used for measuring neutral sugars in oligosaccharides, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. This method is used widely because of its sensitivity and simplicity. In its original form, it required 50–450nmol of monosaccharides or equivalent for analysis and thus is inadequate for precious samples. A scaled-down version requiring only 10–80nmol of sugars was reported previously. We have now modified and optimized this method to use 96-well microplates for high throughput, to gain greater sensitivity, and to economize the reagents. This modified and optimized method allows longer linear range (1–150nmol for Man) and excellent sensitivity. Moreover, our method is more convenient, requiring neither shaking nor covering, and takes less than 15min to complete. The speed and simplicity of this method would make it most suitable for analyses of large numbers of samples such as chromatographic fractions.},

  abstract = {Background Model-based analysis of data from quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is potentially more powerful and versatile than traditional methods. Yet existing model-based approaches cannot properly deal with the higher sampling variances associated with low-abundant targets, nor do they provide a natural way to incorporate assumptions about the stability of control genes directly into the model-fitting process. Results In our method, raw qPCR data are represented as molecule counts, and described using generalized linear mixed models under Poisson-lognormal error. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to sample from the joint posterior distribution over all model parameters, thereby estimating the effects of all experimental factors on the expression of every gene. The Poisson-based model allows for the correct specification of the mean-variance relationship of the PCR amplification process, and can also glean information from instances of no amplification (zero counts). Our method is very flexible with respect to control genes: any prior knowledge about the expected degree of their stability can be directly incorporated into the model. Yet the method provides sensible answers without such assumptions, or even in the complete absence of control genes. We also present a natural Bayesian analogue of the “classic” analysis, which uses standard data pre-processing steps (logarithmic transformation and multi-gene normalization) but estimates all gene expression changes jointly within a single model. The new methods are considerably more flexible and powerful than the standard delta-delta Ct analysis based on pairwise t-tests. Conclusions Our methodology expands the applicability of the relative-quantification analysis protocol all the way to the lowest-abundance targets, and provides a novel opportunity to analyze qRT-PCR data without making any assumptions concerning target stability. These procedures have been implemented as the MCMC.qpcr package in R.},

  abstract = {Marine animals are disappearing, too The loss of animal species in terrestrial environments has been well documented and is continuing. Loss of species in marine environments has been slower than in terrestrial systems, but appears to be increasing rapidly. McCauley et al. review the recent patterns of species decline and loss in marine environments. Though they note many worrying declines, they also highlight approaches that might allow us to prevent the type of massive defaunation that has occurred on land. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1255641 Structured Abstract BACKGROUND Comparing patterns of terrestrial and marine defaunation helps to place human impacts on marine fauna in context and to navigate toward recovery. Defauna­tion began in earnest tens of thousands of years later in the oceans than it did on land. Although defaunation has been less severe in the oceans than on land, our effects on marine animals are increasing in pace and impact. Humans have caused few complete extinctions in the sea, but we are responsible for many ecological, commercial, and local extinctions. Despite our late start, humans have already powerfully changed virtually all major marine ecosystems. ADVANCES Humans have profoundly decreased the abundance of both large (e.g., whales) and small (e.g., anchovies) marine fauna. Such declines can generate waves of ecological change that travel both up and down ma­rine food webs and can alter ocean ecosystem functioning. Human harvesters have also been a major force of evolutionary change in the oceans and have reshaped the genetic structure of marine animal populations. Climate change threatens to accelerate marine defaunation over the next century. The high mobility of many marine animals offers some increased, though limited, capacity for marine species to respond to climate stress, but it also exposes many species to increased risk from other stressors. Because humans are intensely reliant on ocean ecosystems for food and other ecosystem services, we are deeply affected by all of these forecasted changes. Three lessons emerge when comparing the marine and terrestrial defaunation experiences: (i) today’s low rates of marine extinction may be the prelude to a major extinction pulse, similar to that observed on land during the industrial revolution, as the footprint of human ocean use widens; (ii) effectively slowing ocean defaunation requires both protected areas and careful management of the intervening ocean matrix; and (iii) the terrestrial experience and current trends in ocean use suggest that habitat destruction is likely to become an increasingly dominant threat to ocean wildlife over the next 150 years. OUTLOOK Wildlife populations in the oceans have been badly damaged by human activity. Nevertheless, marine fauna generally are in better condition than terrestrial fauna: Fewer marine animal extinctions have occurred; many geographic ranges have shrunk less; and numerous ocean ecosystems remain more wild than terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, meaningful rehabilitation of affected marine animal populations remains within the reach of managers. Human dependency on marine wildlife and the linked fate of marine and terrestrial fauna necessitate that we act quickly to slow the advance of marine defaunation. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6219/1255641/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Timeline (log scale) of marine and terrestrial defaunation. The marine defaunation experience is much less advanced, even though humans have been harvesting ocean wildlife for thousands of years. The recent industrialization of this harvest, however, initiated an era of intense marine wildlife declines. If left unmanaged, we predict that marine habitat alteration, along with climate change (colored bar: IPCC warming), will exacerbate marine defaunation. Marine defaunation, or human-caused animal loss in the oceans, emerged forcefully only hundreds of years ago, whereas terrestrial defaunation has been occurring far longer. Though humans have caused few global marine extinctions, we have profoundly affected marine wildlife, altering the functioning and provisioning of services in every ocean. Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes. Though protected areas are a powerful tool to harness ocean productivity, especially when designed with future climate in mind, additional management strategies will be required. Overall, habitat degradation is likely to intensify as a major driver of marine wildlife loss. Proactive intervention can avert a marine defaunation disaster of the magnitude observed on land.},

We have been studying one population of the polychaete Nereis (Hediste) diversicolor exhibiting inheritable tolerance to extreme copper contamination in estuarine sediment. Using transcriptome sequencing data we have identified a suite of genes with putative roles in metal detoxification and tolerance, and measured their regulation. Copper tolerant individuals display significantly different gene expression profiles compared to animals from a nearby population living without remarkable copper levels. Gene transcripts encoding principle copper homeostasis proteins including membrane copper ion transporters, copper ion chaperones and putative metallothionein-like proteins were significantly more abundant in tolerant animals occupying contaminated sediment. In contrast, those encoding antioxidants and cellular repair pathways were unchanged. Nontolerant animals living in contaminated sediment showed no difference in copper homeostasis-related gene expression but did have significantly elevated levels of mRNAs encoding Glutathione Peroxidase enzymes. This study represents the first use of functional genomics to investigate the copper tolerance trait in this species and provides insight into the mechanism used by these individuals to survive and flourish in conditions which are lethal to their conspecifics.},

To compare the effects of these two groups on sediment oxygen uptake rates, we used experimental microcosms with identical biovolumes to measure the influence of each species on oxygen uptake. The two biodiffusers had similar effects on oxygen uptake in spite of different space occupation and different feeding, ventilation and burrowing modes. Biodiffusers and gallery-diffusers had different effects on oxygen uptake. Periodic ventilation by the gallery-diffusers stimulated the oxygen uptake by the sediment more than the steady activities of the biodiffusers. Temporal variation in oxygen fluxes in bioturbated microcosms was linked to construction and maintenance of biogenic structures. The results confirm that the functional group approach to bioturbation is a useful tool for quantifying the effects of intertidal benthic communities on benthic fluxes.},

  abstract = {Use of potassium persulfate (K2S208) for oxidation of 7.0 mM ABTS to a stable ABTS radical for antioxidant studies was first reported in 1999. A feature of this popular antioxidant assay has been the requirement of an overnight reaction (6 to 12 h) for the formation of a stable ABTS colored radical. It is now reported that when the concentration of ABTS is lowered to 0.7 mM, complete oxidation to the stable cation radical occurs in 30 min, thus circumventing the necessary overnight step. Using this format, it is now possible to accurately assess antioxidant activity based on the potassium persulfate/ABTS format in less than one hour which includes formation time of a stable ABTS radical. This methodology documented the presence of antioxidant properties of plant extracts used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The degree of antioxidant activity was directly related to the extraction method. Greater antioxidant activity was associated with butanol extraction. When incorporated into a microtiter plate format, it supported rapid assessment of multiple determinations of dilutions of plant extracts in less than one hour which included time required for formation of a stable ABTS radical. The ease, improved time prerequisites, and minimal reagent needs with the microtiter plate format, makes this design attractive. It would prove of particular interest to individuals engaged in both smaller and high-volume throughput antioxidant assays of food and health products, and other biological fluids and tissues.},

Many parts of the world are continuing to experience unprecedented rates of economic growth, and those responsible for managing coastal and estuarine areas must respond accordingly. At the same time, global climate change and sea level rise are also continuing, placing new or more intense pressures on coastal areas that must be dealt with in ways that are as far as possible managed as a result of good scientific understanding. There are other pressures too, which depend on the system concerned. This article provides an overview of the papers contained within the Special Issue and provides a discussion of how these fit within the main theme of intense multiple stressors, considering how a balance can be achieved between the needs of various different stakeholders and interest groups, and the sustainability of the system concerned. We categorise the papers in four main groupings: (1) stressors related to sea level rise; (2) stressors related to changes in fresh water inputs; (3) stressors related to anthropogenic pollution; and (4) the use of indicators as a means of assessing the effects of stressors, and reflect on the fact that despite the diversity of different challenges and geographical regions involved many of the approaches and discussions contained within the Special Issue have strong similarities, leading to a set of overarching principles that should be considered when making recommendations on management strategies.},

Its ecotoxicity was tested using the benthic keystone species Hediste diversicolor as target species. After 10 days of exposure to different levels of inorganic Hg (10 and 50\,μg\,L−1), bioaccumulation and a wide range of biological responses were evaluated at different biological levels, including biomarkers of exposure, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, genotoxicity and cytochemistry. In controlled laboratory conditions, Hg was taken up by H.~diversicolor in a dose-response manner and caused a range of biological responses, including oxidative stress (GSTs, GPx, GSH-2GSSG, and TOSCA), neurotoxicity (AChE), and cellular damages at the membrane level (LFs, NLs, Ca2+-ATPase); however, it did not cause significant DNA damage or mortality. This study confirms the capability of H.~diversicolor to tolerate high levels of metals and clarifies the mechanisms underlying the damage caused by waterborne Hg and the defense mechanisms, activated in this species. In particular, detoxification of the inorganic form of Hg in this species was found to be strongly related to glutathione expression and several antioxidant enzymes of the antioxidant system. This process also efficiently minimized negative effects on DNA and prevented death, but was not sufficient to avoid neurotoxicity and some cellular damages, mainly at the intestinal level.},

  abstract = {This study evaluated a short-term sublethal endpoint for in situ toxicity assays for estuarine sediments, based on postexposure feeding of the polychaete Hediste (Nereis) diversicolor Müller. A method for precisely quantifying postexposure feeding rates of H. diversicolor was established under laboratory conditions using Artemia franciscana Kellog nauplii. The sensitivity of the postexposure feeding response to copper was investigated by comparing postexposure feeding rates to growth and lethality. The 48-h and 96-h median lethal concentration (LC50) of copper were 241 and 125 μg/L, respectively, whereas the 48-h median inhibitory concentration (IC50) for postexposure feeding and the 20-d IC50 for growth were 52 and 25 μg/L of copper, respectively. The influence of different exposure conditions (substrate, temperature, salinity, food availability, and light) on H. diversicolor postexposure feeding was assessed; temperature and salinity were found to influence significantly postexposure feeding. The effectiveness of the proposed in situ assay was investigated by deploying it at two reference and six contaminated Portuguese estuaries. A 48-h exposure period was followed by a 1-h postexposure feeding period. High organism recoveries (89–100\%) were obtained. Postexposure feeding was depressed significantly (17–90\%) at all contaminated sites relatively to reference sites. The proposed in situ assay with H. diversicolor was shown to be a potential useful tool for estuarine sediment toxicity testing.},

  abstract = {This study aimed at integrating postexposure feeding and some biochemical parameters in the responses of the estuarine polychaeta, Hediste diversicolor, to controlled laboratory exposure conditions and to in situ exposures scenario of sediment contamination. Since H. diversicolor feeding may be considered as a major rate-limiting step in the processing of detritus in European estuaries, a reduction in feeding activity may have implications not only at the individual and population level of the species but also in detritus processing and in organic matter decomposition rates at the ecosystem level. The biochemical parameters were chosen as indicators of four key physiological functions: neurotransmission, metabolic condition, detoxification processes and antioxidant defences. The Mira and Sado estuaries, located in the Southwest coast of Portugal and classified as undisturbed and impacted, respectively, were selected as sites for this study. A significant depression in H. diversicolor postexposure feeding (from 30 to 70\%) was consistently detected in all impacted sediments, supporting the sensitivity and responsiveness of feeding as a sublethal toxicity endpoint. Alongside with a reduced energy intake, an increased rate of organisms’ anaerobic metabolism, as evidenced by an enhancement of lactate dehydrogenase activity (up to 1.5-fold), suggested a rapid need of additional energy to ameliorate chemical stress. Moreover, oxidative stress was shown to be an important mechanism of toxicity of the impacted sediments in H. diversicolor, as evidenced by a marked reduction in the glutathione redox status (up to 6.5-fold) and an increase in lipid peroxides levels (up to 2.3-fold) in organisms exposed to the most impacted sediments. Results of the in situ assay, conducted to assess the ecological relevance of sediment laboratory toxicity estimates and their application to make valid field extrapolations, revealed a lack of agreement in the response of catalase in organisms exposed to moderate impacted sediments. Our results support the utility of integrating responses at individual and sub-individual level to evaluate potential toxicant-induced changes in key physiological functions of H. diversicolor and to interpret their potential ecological consequences.},

Residues were quantified by liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry. Both flame retardants were enriched in sewage sludges, where a maximum total (Σ) HBCD concentration of 9.1 mg/kg (dry weight; d.w.) was found; TBBPA was at levels of 102 μg/kg. Landfill leachates from The Netherlands showed up to 36 mg (ΣHBCD)/kg (d.w.). γ-HBCD dominated isomeric profiles in sediments, and concentrations were elevated near to a site of HBCD manufacture. α-HBCD was the primary congener detected in marine mammals; however, very few samples exhibited TBBPA. ΣHBCD ranged from 2.1 to 6.8 mg/kg (lipid weight; l.w.) in liver and blubber of harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and seals (Phoca vitulina). TBBPA levels in cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) livers were up to 1 order of magnitude lower compared to ΣHBCD. HBCD in eels (Anguilla anguilla) from the Scheldt basin (Belgium) reflected the spatial distribution of concentrations in local sediments. This study shows evidence of HBCD bioaccumulation at the trophic level and biomagnification in the ascending aquatic food chain, and these findings justify risk assessment studies at the ecosystem level.},

We address this knowledge gap by testing the ability of three contrasting null models to predict the joint impacts of warming and a range of other aquatic stressors using a new database of 296 experimental combinations. Despite concerns that stressors will interact to cause synergisms, we found that net impacts were usually best explained by the effect of the stronger stressor alone (the dominance null model), especially if this stressor was a local disturbance associated with human land use. Prediction accuracy depended on stressor identity and how asymmetric stressors were in the magnitude of their effects. These findings suggest we can effectively predict the impacts of multiple stressors by focusing on the stronger stressor, as habitat alteration, nutrients and contamination often override the biological consequences of higher temperatures in freshwater ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Polychaete worms (Hediste diversicolor) originating from a strongly metal-contaminated area (Restronguet Creek) and a relatively clean site (Blackwater estuary) were exposed to a range of experimental doses of Ag, Cd, Cu and Zn. Specimens from both populations were compared to assess their relative sensitivity to metal stress and the physiological mechanisms involved in their respective adaptive strategies for coping with increased metal exposures. Taking into account the LC50 values, increased tolerance to Cd, Cu and Zn of the Restronguet Creek worms over that of the Blackwater was demonstrated, whereas the opposite was shown for Ag. An abundant secretion of mucus in response to toxicants was observed, possibly reducing metal availability for uptake, at least under laboratory conditions. This mechanism was particularly active in specimens from Restronguet Creek exposed to Ag and Cu. Unexpectedly, of the two worm populations, Blackwater worms contained significantly higher concentrations of cytosolic heat-stable compounds (CHSTC), a category of cytosolic components that includes metallothioneins, the detoxificatory role of which is well documented, and other compounds binding trace metals via sulphur bonds. However, the concentration of such compounds is not totally representative in itself of their involvement in metal detoxification, because a high rate of their turnover in metal-exposed worms might be responsible for (at least) the Cu storage associated with S in lysosomes as a consequence of the breakdown of Cu-thionein. Cu-containing lysosomes were abundant in epidermal cells of Restronguet Creek worms, but were lacking in Blackwater worms. Extracellular granules present in the epicuticle also contained S and Cu, their number and size being much more important in Restronguet Creek worms, and they appear to be a major detoxificatory store for accumulated Cu. Spherocrystals in cells of the gut wall seem to be the major detoxified store of Zn in Restronguet Creek worms, whereas in specimens from the Blackwater they were also present but contained only S and Ca at detectable levels. Evidence was also found for the presence of detoxificatory intracellular structures containing other metals and metalloids in the tegument and gut epithelium of Restronguet Creek worms.},

  abstract = {In coastal areas, sessile species can be severely affected by thermal stress associated to climate change. Presently, the effect of elevated temperature on metabolic, cellular and tissue-level responses of mussels was determined to assess whether the responses vary seasonally with seawater temperature and reproductive stage. Mussels were collected in fall, winter and summer, and (a) maintained at 16, 12, and 20~°C respectively or (b) subject to gradual temperature elevation for 8 days (+1~°C per day; from 16 to 24~°C in fall, from 12 to 20~°C in winter and from 20 to 28~°C in summer) and further maintained at 24~°C (fall), 20~°C (winter) and 28~°C (summer) for the following 6 days. Temperature elevation induced membrane destabilization, lysosomal enlargement, and reduced the aerobic scope in fall and summer whereas in winter no significant changes were found. Changes at tissue-level were only evident at 28~°C. Gamete development was impaired irrespective of season. Since the threshold of negative effects of warming was close to ambient temperatures in summer (24~°C or above) studied mussel populations would be vulnerable to the global climate change.},

The sediments of the examined sections of the Baltic coast compare with North Sea sediments by factors of between 0.05 and 4 with regard to heavy metals.

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner’s instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

  abstract = {A battery of biochemical parameters was used to evaluate the response of mussels to a contaminated coastal environment. A multimarker approach was developed, establishing a scale for the classification of the water quality in European coastal sites (BIOMAR European programme). This study allows the evaluation of the temporal trends of this scale when applied to selected sites of European Mediterranean coast (BEEP Biological Effects of Environmental Pollution in Marine Coastal Ecosystems: European programme). Acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) is highly sensitive to organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides and, to some extent, also to heavy metals. Catalase activity (CAT) and lipid oxidation (evaluated as malonedialdehyde) are markers of oxidative stress, glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity is related to conjugation of organic compounds and benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase activity (BPH) is a marker of effect of certain planar organic compounds (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs). These parameters were measured either in gills (AChE, GST) or digestive gland (BPH, GST, CAT, MDA). For each biomarker, a discriminatory factor was calculated (maximum variation range/confidence interval) and a response index was allocated. For each site, a Multimarker Pollution Index (MPI) was calculated as the sum of the response index of each of the five more discriminating biomarkers. As the result of our calculation method, the quality of the coastal environment at each site can be classified according to a five levels scale. Samples collected for five cruises in May 2001, 2002, 2003, and September 2001 and 2002 showed MPI evolutions. The results show that water quality can be classified from class 1 (clean areas in some sites of France, Italy and Spain) to class 4 (high pollution in main harbours). Results of the use of the biomarker scale in WP3 (Work Package Concernant Biomonitoring Programmes in Mediterranean Sea) during the BEEP programme make a strong contribution to the establishment of standardized strategies and methods for internationally agreed protocols for biomarkerbased monitoring programmes. In comparison with scale pollution methodology used in the BIOMAR programme, the main contribution of BEEP was (1) to select from discriminatory analysis the biomarkers to be included in calculation of scale pollution; (2) to improve the use of the biomarker index in order to identify the main contaminants by analysis of individual contributions to the MPI; and (3) to apply methodology for temporal trends at sampled sites.},

  abstract = {Throughout evolution, all organisms have harnessed the redox properties of copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) as a cofactor or structural determinant of proteins that perform critical functions in biology. At its most sobering stance to Earth's biome, Cu biochemistry allows photosynthetic organisms to harness solar energy and convert it into the organic energy that sustains the existence of all nonphotosynthetic life forms. The conversion of organic energy, in the form of nutrients that include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids, is subsequently released during cellular respiration, itself a Cu-dependent process, and stored as ATP that is used to drive a myriad of critical biological processes such as enzyme-catalyzed biosynthetic processes, transport of cargo around cells and across membranes, and protein degradation. The life-supporting properties of Cu incur a significant challenge to cells that must not only exquisitely balance intracellular Cu concentrations, but also chaperone this redox-active metal from its point of cellular entry to its ultimate destination so as to avert the potential for inappropriate biochemical interactions or generation of damaging reactive oxidative species (ROS). In this review we chart the travels of Cu from the extracellular milieu of fungal and mammalian cells, its path within the cytosol as inferred by the proteins and ligands that escort and deliver Cu to intracellular organelles and protein targets, and its journey throughout the body of mammals.

A survey of the co-ordination chemistry of metal ions in biological systems (mostly X-ray crystallographic data) demonstrates the potential for grouping metal ions according to their binding preferences (i.e. whether they seek out O-, N- or S-containing ligands). This classification is related to atomic properties and the solution chemistry of metal ions. A convenient graphical display of the metals in each of the three categories is achieved by a plot of a covalent-bonding index versus an ionic-bonding index. A review of the roles of metal ions in biological systems demonstrates the potential of the proposed classification for interpreting the biochemical basis for metal-ion toxicity and its use in the rational selection of metal ions in toxicity studies.},

The toxicity of nanoparticles and its interaction with the important environmental stressors (such as salinity variation) are not well understood in coastal organisms and require further investigation. Here, we examined the interactive effects of 100~μg~l−1 nZnO or dissolved Zn (as a positive control for Zn2+ release) and salinity (normal 15, low 5, and fluctuating 5–15) on bioenergetics and intermediate metabolite homeostasis of a keystone marine bivalve, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis from the Baltic Sea. nZnO exposures did not lead to strong disturbances in energy or intermediate metabolite homeostasis regardless of the salinity regime. Dissolved Zn exposures suppressed the mitochondrial ATP synthesis capacity and coupling as well as anaerobic metabolism and modified the free amino acid profiles in the mussels indicating that dissolved Zn is metabolically more damaging than nZnO. The environmental salinity regime strongly affected metabolic homeostasis and altered physiological and biochemical responses to nZnO or dissolved Zn in the mussels. Exposure to low (5) or fluctuating (5–15) salinity affected the physiological condition, energy metabolism and homeostasis, as well as amino acid metabolism in M. edulis. Generally, fluctuating salinity (5–15) appeared bioenergetically less stressful than constantly hypoosmotic stress (salinity 5) in M. edulis indicating that even short (24~h) periods of recovery might be sufficient to restore the metabolic homeostasis in this euryhaline species. Notably, the biological effects of nZnO and dissolved Zn became progressively less detectable as the salinity stress increased. These findings demonstrate that habitat salinity must be considered in the biomarker-based assessment of the toxic effects of nanopollutants on coastal organisms.},

  abstract = {The toxic effects of copper on numerous aquatic flora and fauna has been studied intensely over the past 10 years. In general, there is a consensus that free cupric ions are more toxic if compared with other chemical forms such as organically complexed copper. Biological indicators exhibit a tremendously wide range of sensitivity to copper with toxic effects noted at pCu as low as 10 for some algae, while aquatic macrophytes appear to have a much higher tolerance for copper (pCu {$<$} 5.0). The sensitivity of various groups of organisms seems discrepant and anomalous with accepted standards for drinking water and industrial discharges, and recommended rates of copper sulfate application to water bodies. The toxicity of copper, however, is mitigated by the presence of naturally occurring organic compounds in waters through complexation. The regulatory function of dissolved humic matter will continue to be a vital one for as long as copper is discharged into aquatic environments.},

  abstract = {Nowadays there are various groups of biocidal chemical agents, which can be used in diverse areas, such as personal hygiene, disinfection, antiparasitic action, and also in antifouling mixtures or paints. The versatility and efficacy of some of these agents favors their use and ultimate release into the aquatic environment, where they may still exert toxic activity. Zinc pyrithione is classified as a metal biocide with bactericidal, algicidal, and fungicidal actions. It has been formulated in antifouling paints, which prevent the formation of biofilms in submerged structures, and has also been used for dermocosmetic purposes, in shampoos for the treatment of dandruff and seborrhea. Some of the uses of zinc pyrithione are responsible for its direct release as flakes that reach the bottom sediments, especially in estuarine areas. Considering this fate, the ecotoxicity assessment of its effects towards sediment organisms, namely Polychaetous species, is extremely important. The present study characterized the acute potential toxicity of zinc pyrithione in terms of parameters of oxidative stress (catalase, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)), and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase) which were evaluated in individuals of the polychaete Hediste diversicolor. Regarding the results obtained, only the activity of GSTs and AChE was significantly altered in relation to non-exposed animals. This set of results indicates that oxidative stress did not occur.},

  abstract = {The use of pharmaceutical drugs has systematically increased, resulting in their environmental presence and exertion of effects on non-target aquatic organisms. Diclofenac (DCF) is an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug, frequently found in the aquatic compartment. The present work analyzed the ecotoxicological effects of DCF in the marine polychaete Hediste diversicolor and in the marine fish Solea senegalensis. In addition, the putative toxic effects of DCF along a simulated food chain were studied, by feeding individuals of S. senegalensis with H. diversicolor previously exposed to DCF. Biomarkers of anti-oxidant defense (catalase, CAT), phase II metabolism (glutathione S-transferases, GSTs) and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) were quantified. The obtained results demonstrated that DCF did not affect CAT activity in organisms of both species directly exposed through the water, suggesting the absence of oxidative effects. In addition, organisms directly or indirectly exposed to DCF showed an increase of GSTs activities, suggesting an additional challenge to the metabolism of the exposed individuals. However, significant decreases in the activities of CAT and AChE were observed in fish fed with worms previously exposed to DCF. These data suggest that direct or indirect exposure to DCF may cause significant physiological modifications in aquatic organisms. In addition, exposure of wild organisms via contaminated food may lead to toxicological effects which may differ from alterations elicited by direct exposure. Such toxicological differences, between direct (waterborne) and trophic (via contaminated feed) exposures were qualitatively distinct, and need to be fully addressed when considering the consequences of environmental contamination by therapeutic drugs.},

  abstract = {Natural systems are threatened by a variety of anthropogenic stressors and so understanding the interactive threats posed by multiple stressors is essential. In this study we focused on urban stressors that are ubiquitous to urban estuarine systems worldwide: elevated nutrients, toxic chemical contaminants, built infrastructure and non-indigenous species (NIS). We investigated structural (abundance, diversity and species richness) and functional endpoints (productivity, primary production (chlorophyll-a) and metabolism) commonly used to determine responses to these selected stressors. Through a systematic review of global literature, we found 579 studies of our selected stressors; 93\% measured responses to a single stressor, with few assessing the effects of multiple stressors (7\%). Structural endpoints were commonly used to measure the effects of stressors (49\% of the total 579 studies). Whereas, functional endpoints were rarely assessed alone (10\%) but rather in combination with structural endpoints (41\%). Elevated nutrients followed by NIS were the most studied single stressors (43\% and 16\% of the 541 single stressor studies), while elevated nutrients and toxic contaminants were overwhelmingly the most common stressor combination (79\% of the 38 multiple stressor studies); with NIS and built infrastructure representing major gaps in multi-stressor research. In the meta-analysis, structural endpoints tended to decrease, while functional endpoints increased and/or decreased in response to different types of organisms or groups. We predicted an antagonistic effect of elevated nutrients and toxic contaminants based on the opposing enriching versus toxic effects of this stressor combination. Of note, biodiversity was the only endpoint that revealed such an antagonistic response. Our results highlight the continuing paucity of multiple stressor studies and provide evidence for opposing patterns in the responses to single and interacting stressors depending on the measured endpoint. The latter is of significant consequence to understanding relevant impacts of stressors in coastal monitoring and management.},

  abstract = {Hurlbert divides experimental ecologist into ‘those who do not see any need for dispersion (of replicated treatments and controls), and those who do recognize its importance and take whatever measures are necessary to achieve a good dose of it’. Experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. If an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. Conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. This approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. For a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. By definition, a prediction is an ‘all-statement’, referring to all systems within a well-defined category. What applies to all must apply to any. Hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment. The strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. Replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. Whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations. The concept ‘pseudoreplication’ amounts to entirely unwarranted stigmatization of a reasonable way to test predictions referring to large-scale systems.},

  abstract = {Necrotic cell death was long regarded as the ultimate consequence of chemical toxicity and was thought to result from simple cell failure because of toxic interference with vital cell functions. Introduction of the novel concept of programmed cell death (PCD), or apoptosis, has changed this view dramatically. This development has been further stimulated by the characterization of several other genetically PCD modalities, such as autophagy and pyroptosis. Like apoptosis, these modes of cell death are governed by complex signaling networks, containing “switches” responsible for cross talk between them. Recruitment or repression of these cell death signaling networks by foreign chemicals can lead to acute as well as chronic toxicity. In many instances, such effects of toxicants are mediated by disruption/modulation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis or increased generation of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria or other intracellular compartments. Caspases, calpains, lysosomal proteases, and endonucleases are the main executioners of cell death, and they often co-operate during the execution stage of apoptosis. Finally, dead or dying cells are recognized and engulfed by phagocytes to prevent inflammation and associated tissue damage. Defective macrophage engulfment and degradation of cell corpses may also result from toxicity and can contribute to both the inflammatory response and dysregulation of tissue homeostasis. Hence, the cell death and phagocytosis regulatory networks offer a multitude of targets for toxic chemicals.},

Despite the number of studies carried out, relatively little is known about the metal fraction that is biologically available. In this study, we analyzed seasonal concentrations of acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) as well as heavy metals associated with the reactive (soluble in 1 M HCl) and pyrite (soluble in HNO3) fractions of the soils of three salt marshes in the ría of Ortigueira (NW Iberian Peninsula). Heavy metal concentrations in polychaete worms (Nereis diversicolor) collected from each salt marsh were also determined and compared with metal contents in the different fractions of the soil. We did not find a relationship between the concentration of total metal or metal incorporated into the reactive fraction in the soil and the tissue-metal concentration in N. diversicolor. The results appear to indicate that this species preferentially accumulates metals associated with reduced forms of sulfur (pyrite and presumably AVS). Oxidation of these metal sulfides would lead to release of Cu and Ni into interstitial water and they would then be readily available to be taken up by these organisms, either by absorption through the body surface or across the digestive tract.},

Low concentrations of 5 and 20 μg/liter copper were more inhibitory to 1-day and 7-day old larvae, respectively, than were higher copper levels. The responses of 1-day-old larvae to copper levels from 0 to 20 μg/liter and of 7-day-old to copper levels from 0 to 100 μg/liter copper were complex.

The present study focused on eight populations of zebra mussels and aimed to describe how variable are biomarkers in different sampling locations. Biomarkers were investigated and summarised through the Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR index). Inter-site differences in IBR index were analysed through comparisons with morphological data, proteomic profiles and genetic background of the studied populations. We found that the IBR index was a good tool to inform about the status of sites. It revealed higher stress in more polluted sites than in cleaner ones. It was neither correlated to proteomic profiles nor to genetic background, suggesting a stronger influence of environment than genes. Meanwhile, morphological traits were related to both environment and genetic background influence. Together these results attest the benefit of using biological tools to better illustrate the status of a population and highlight the need of consider inter-population difference in their baselines.},

For this reason, the measurement of biomarkers in soil bioindicator organisms, such as earthworms, has recently received increasing attention. In this study, the earthworm Eisenia andrei was used to assess the pollutant-induced stress syndrome after exposure to sublethal concentrations of Cd (10 or 100~μg~g−1) in OECD soil, after 14~d of exposure. Cadmium bioaccumulation and potential biomarkers such as catalase (CAT), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), malondialdehyde (MDA), phenoloxidase (PO), metallothioneins (MTs) and genotoxic damage were determined. Results suggested that the exposure to 10 and 100~μg~g−1~Cd significantly increased Cd bioaccumulation, MTs and MDA; 100~μg~g−1~Cd contamination evidenced significantly higher values of H2O2 content and PO activity; CAT activity was inhibited at the higher concentration while GST and Comet assay did not show any significant differences from the control. Rank-based biomarker index showed that both different contaminated soils had an effect on the earthworms and allowed to validate the ecotoxicological relevance of this battery of biomarkers for a promising integrated multi-marker approach in soil monitoring and assessment.},

Two studies were carried out, the first involved sequential exposure to copper at 0.02 and 0.05ppm followed by the bacterium Vibrio tubiashii. In the second study, mussels were simultaneously exposed to copper and V. tubiashii. Both studies were carried out at 10 and 15°C, to ascertain whether temperature had an additional effect on immunocompetence. A multi-assay approach was used to obtain an overall view of immune function in the mussels. Assays carried out included total and differential haemocyte counts, production of intracellular superoxide and phagocytosis by haemocytes. Data are presented showing significant effects on immune parameters of sequential and simultaneous exposure to copper and V. tubiashii at 10 and 15°C. Each of the factors considered were shown to have a significant effect on at least one of the immune parameters measured. There were also significant effects due to the interaction of these factors. The response of total and differential blood cell counts to copper were shown to alter, if mussels were exposed in a sequential manner as opposed to simultaneous exposure. The results confirmed that the immune system of M. edulis is susceptible to copper at relatively low concentrations. Furthermore, the effects of copper alter with environmental variables, including temperature and the presence of a potential pathogen. The complexity of the interactions demonstrate that extrapolation of data obtained from single stressor studies into field situations could give a misleading picture.},

  abstract = {The release of potentially toxic metals, such as copper (Cu), into the water column is of concern during polymetallic nodule mining. The bioavailability and thus toxicity of Cu is strongly influenced by its speciation which is dominated by organic ligand (L) complexation in seawater, with L-complexes being considered less bioavailable than free Cu2+. The presence of CuL-complexes in deep-sea sediments has, however, not been systematically studied in the context of deep-sea mining. We thus analyzed the Cu-binding L concentration ([L]) in deep-sea pore waters of two polymetallic nodule provinces in the Pacific Ocean, the Peru Basin and the Clarion-Clipperton-Zone, using competitive ligand equilibration–adsorptive stripping voltammetry. The pore-water dissolved Cu concentration ([dCu]) ranged from 3 to 96~nM, generally exceeding bottom water concentrations (4–44~nM). Based on fitting results from ProMCC and Excel, Cu was predominantly complexed by L (3–313~nM) in bottom waters and undisturbed pore waters. We conclude that processes like deep-sea mining are unlikely to cause a release of toxic Cu2+ concentrations ([Cu2+]) to the seawater as\,{$>$}\,99\% Cu was organically complexed in pore waters and the [Cu2+] was\,{$<$}\,6~pM for 8 of 9 samples. Moreover, the excess of L found especially in shallow pore waters implied that even with a Cu release through mining activities, Cu2+ likely remains beneath toxic thresholds.},

  abstract = {Objective Sunscreens play a major role in the EU sun protection strategy in order to prevent humans from UV light-induced skin damage. In recent years, the demand for high-quality sunscreen products including aspects of broad range and photostability of the UV protection, showing good spreadability onto human skin and excellent sensorial properties during and after application has increased. Environmental aspects are considered. Sunscreens are complex compositions, with UV filters being the key element in the formulations reaching up to about 30\% in content in the final product. Some of these ingredients, however, may be regarded as hazardous for the aquatic environment. Nevertheless, the aquatic ecosystem represents only a single environmental compartment, which may be impacted by UV filters. Therefore, the EcoSun Pass (ESP) tool was developed in order to assess the overall environmental impact of UV filters in combination with its efficacy (Sun Protection Factor, SPF and UVA Protection Factor, UVA-PF). Methods For that purpose, at first 24 of the EU-approved UV filters for sunscreen applications were evaluated for their environmental hazard profiles. Nine example UV filter compositions representing both SPF 30 and 50 were evaluated for ecofriendliness using the ESP tool. Results The results revealed that two out of four SPF 30 compositions are considered as ecofriendly. Likewise, from the SPF 50 two out of five did meet the criteria for ecofriendliness. Furthermore, the results showed that most ecofriendly example formulations have also the lowest overall UV filter content in the product, based on the use of highly innovative and least hazardous UV filters. Conclusion These results demonstrate that the tool is applicable to various formulations being present on the market and thus allows for a selection of most ecofriendly and efficient UV filters to be used in sunscreens.},

Cross-sectional surveys were carried out among university students in thirteen European countries in 1990 (n=10,241) and 2000 (n=10,161). Sun protection behavior and beliefs about the importance of sunscreen use for health were measured. Results. There was little change in the proportion of men and women who sunbathed, but use of sun protection increased over the 10-year interval from 52\% to 63\% in men and 80\% to 87\% in women. There was wide variation in sun protection use and strength of health beliefs between countries. The association between strength of beliefs and behavior was more marked in 2000 than 1990. Sun protection behavior was positively associated with the socioeconomic background of participants. Conclusion. The use of sunscreen increased among educated young Europeans from several countries over the 1990s, but important sex differences remain. Awareness of the risk to health of unprotected sunbathing is high, but there is scope of strengthening attitudes to sunscreen use.},

Müller, 1776), a common species in estuaries and coastal lagoons, plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems and is a suitable bioindicator of environmental chemical contamination. In this study, H. diversicolor was chosen as an ecotoxicological model with the aim of evaluating the responses to Cd contamination, considering a multi-biomarker approach (mortality, biometry, behaviour, Cd bioaccumulation, oxidative stress and damage, and energy metabolism). Also, the hypothesis of different tolerances resulting in different responses was evaluated, by collecting worms from three systems distinctly impacted by metal contamination (Mondego estuary, Óbidos Lagoon and Sado estuary – Portugal). Animals were exposed under laboratory conditions to cadmium (10, 50 and 100~µg/L), for 10 days. Significant differences were observed in responses amongst worms originating from the different sites. Organisms from the less impacted systems revealed greater effects on mortality, biomass decrease and burrowing behaviour, as well as higher bioaccumulation potential, after exposure to Cd. Biochemical and behaviour impairments were observed as a consequence of Cd exposure, although not in a concentration-dependant manner. The results obtained in this study reinforce the importance of integrating endpoint responses, at the individual and sub-individual levels, to assess potential changes induced by pollutants in the physiological status and fitness of H. diversicolor and help to predict what their ecological consequences might be.},

Experimental temperature treatments were designed within the context of a high-emission CO2, “business as usual” scenario, with an approximate median increase in temperature of 3.7–4.8°C by the year 2100. In this study, it was investigated whether oxidative stress occurs in cellular responses to elevated temperatures and CO2 levels in N. diversicolor. It was measured the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers, of hemoglobin, and of the carbonate system. The effects of ocean acidification on these organisms are almost unknown. This study has shown that when subject to pH and temperature stress, the Nereidid polychaete N. diversicolor exhibits reduced survival rates. Also the biomarker (Lipid Peroxidation—LPO) was also found to be sensitive to the pH versus temperature relationship.},

The aim of our study was to relate various biomarker responses in these species to a pollution gradient caused by untreated domestic discharges and to verify the adequacy of the selected species as sentinels in this habitat. The biomarkers selected were the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and DT-diaphorase (DT-D). In addition, the activities of cytochrome P450-dependent ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity, the phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the neurotoxicity marker acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were measured. Metallothionein levels were selected as biomarkers of heavy metals exposure in both species. The results suggest a different response in the water filtering organism (clam) and the sediment eater (polychaete), probably as a consequent of different pollution exposure and that samples from the “Caño Sancti-Petri” were exposed to biologically active compounds that altered some of their biochemical responses. AChE was the most sensitive biomarker in both species and N. diversicolor proved to be a more robust sentinel in this ecosystem.},

Real-time PCR is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time RT–PCR of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to RNA integrity, sample loading and inter-PCR variations. High accuracy and reproducibility (\&lt;2.5\% variation) were reached in LightCycler PCR using the established mathematical model.},

  abstract = {The elucidation of the comparative pollution of aquatic areas by trace metals is theoretically possible by the analysis of water, sediments, or a member of the indigenous biota. The use of water analysis is expensive and laborious; multiple sampling must be undertaken to eliminate variations in metal concentration with time, season, freshwater run-off, currents, tides and other factors. The use of sediments is also subject to some error, according to local variations in sedimentation rates of particulate material and in the amounts of organic material present; in addition it gives little direct information on the amounts of metal entering the biomass of a given area. The use of biological indicator organisms to define areas of trace metal pollution appears most attractive, as these organisms not only concentrate metals from water, allowing inexpensive and relatively simple analysis, but they may also represent a moving time-averaged value for the relative biological availability of metals at each site studied. However, the use of indicator organisms introduces biological variables which are not present in physico-chemical studies of water or sediments. These variables merit consideration inasmuch as they may affect the results of indicator surveys for trace metals. In addition, different indicator organisms measure different portions of the total trace metal load on an ecosystem. The present state of knowledge on the use of indicator organisms to study trace metal pollution is reviewed, with particular reference to the use of macroalgae, bivalve molluscs and teleosts. It is suggested that the macroalgae and bivalve molluscs are the most efficient and reliable indicators developed to the present time. It is further suggested that the effects of sampling and environmental variables have been largely overlooked, and that further study in the field and in the laboratory is necessary before the results of surveys using biological indicator organisms can be relied upon.},

  abstract = {Permutation tests are amongst the most commonly used statistical tools in modern genomic research, a process by which p-values are attached to a test statistic by randomly permuting the sample or gene labels. Yet permutation p-values published in the genomic literature are often computed incorrectly, understated by about 1/m, where m is the number of permutations. The same is often true in the more general situation when Monte Carlo simulation is used to assign p-values. Although the p-value understatement is usually small in absolute terms, the implications can be serious in a multiple testing context. The understatement arises from the intuitive but mistaken idea of using permutation to estimate the tail probability of the test statistic. We argue instead that permutation should be viewed as generating an exact discrete null distribution. The relevant literature, some of which is likely to have been relatively inaccessible to the genomic community, is reviewed and summarized. A computation strategy is developed for exact p-values when permutations are randomly drawn. The strategy is valid for any number of permutations and samples. Some simple recommendations are made for the implementation of permutation tests in practice.},

In their highly cited meta-analysis, Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) assumed in situations with opposing individual effects that synergy only occurs when the cumulative effect is more negative than the additive sum of the opposing individual effects. We argue against this and propose a new systematic classification based on an additive effects model that combines the magnitude and response direction of the cumulative effect and the interaction effect. A new class of “mitigating synergism” is identified, where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced. We applied our directional classification to the dataset compiled by Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) to determine the prevalence of synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions. Compared to their original analysis, we report differences in the representation of interaction classes by interaction type and we document examples of mitigating synergism, highlighting the importance of incorporating individual stressor effect directions in the determination of synergisms and antagonisms. This is particularly pertinent given a general bias in ecology toward investigating and reporting adverse multiple stressor effects (double negative). We emphasize the need for reconsideration by the ecological community of the interpretation of synergism and antagonism in situations where individual stressor effects oppose each other or where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced.},

Although the conceptual basis for each index may rely on different assumptions and parameters, they share a common goal: to provide a useful tool that can be used in assessing the system's health and that could be applied in decision making. This paper focuses mainly on benthic community-based, biotic indices. We supply a general overview of several indices premises and assumptions as well as their main advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, an illustrative example is provided of a straightforward application of benthic index of biotic integrity and benthic condition index. As a reference, their performance is compared to the Portuguese-benthic assessment tool. Limitations of the tested indices are discussed in context of the Mondego estuary (Portugal) case study.},

  abstract = {Several environmental stressors have been identified as key and/or emerging drivers of habitat change that could significantly influence marine near-shore ecosystems. These include increasing discharges of pharmaceutical contaminants into the aquatic coastal systems. Pharmaceutical drugs are often detected in aquatic environments but still information on their toxicity impacts on inhabiting species is scarce, especially when acting in combination. Furthermore, almost no information is available on the impacts of pharmaceuticals in polychaetes, often the most abundant taxon in benthic communities and commonly used as indicator species of environmental conditions. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the biochemical alterations induced in the polychaete Hediste diversicolor, from a low contaminated area at the Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Portugal), by the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (0.0 - control, 0.3, 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0μg/L) and the stimulant caffeine (0.0 - control, 0.5, 3.0, and 18.0μg/L), acting alone and in combination (0.3 CBZ+0.5 CAF and 6.0 CBZ+3.0 CAF). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities was determined in Hediste diversicolor from each condition. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione reduced and oxidized (GSH and GSSG), glycogen and electron transport system (ETS) were also measured. The results obtained clearly revealed that both drugs induced oxidative stress in H. diversicolor, shown by the increase on LPO levels and decrease on total glutathione and GSH/GSSG ratio with the increase of exposure concentrations. Furthermore, the present findings demonstrated that polychaetes biotransformation capacity as well as antioxidant defense mechanisms were not sufficiently efficient to fight against the excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to LPO when organisms were exposed to both drugs. Our results also demonstrated that polychaetes tended to decrease the activity of ETS when exposed to drugs, avoiding energy expenditure which may prevent them from greater damages. The present study further revealed that the impacts induced by the combination of both drugs were similar to those obtained at the highest drugs concentrations acting alone.},

  abstract = {Numerous applications exist for graphene-based materials, such as graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. Increased concentrations of GO nanosheets in the environment have the potential to have a large negative effect on the aquatic environment, with consequences for benthic organisms, such as polychaetes. The polychaete Hediste diversicolor mobilises the sediments, hence altering the availability of contaminants and the nutrients biogeochemical cycle. As such, this study proposes to assess the effects of different GO nanosheet concentrations on the behaviour, feeding activity, mucus production, regenerative capacity, antioxidant status, biochemical damage and metabolism of H. diversicolor. This study evidenced that H. diversicolor exposed to GO nanosheets had a significantly lower ability to regenerate their bodies, took longer to feed and burrow into the sediment and produced more mucus. Membrane oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation) increased in exposed specimens. The increased metabolic rate (ETS) evidenced a higher energy expenditure in exposed organisms (high use of ready energy sources – soluble sugars) to fight the toxicity induced by GO nanosheets, such as SOD activity. The increase in SOD activity was enough to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by GO on cytosol at the lowest concentrations, avoiding the damage on proteins (lower PC levels), but not on membranes (LPO increase). This study revealed that the presence of GO nanosheets, even at the lower levels tested, impaired behavioural, physiological, and biochemical traits in polychaetes, suggesting that the increase of this engineered nanomaterial in the environment can disturb these benthic organisms, affecting the H. diversicolor population. Moreover, given the important role of this group of organisms in coastal and estuarine food webs, the biogeochemical cycle of nutrients, and sediment oxygenation, there is a real possibility for repercussions into the estuarine community.},

  abstract = {Quality assessments are crucial to all activities related to removal and management of sediments. Following a multidisciplinary, weight of evidence approach, a new model is presented here for comprehensive assessment of hazards associated to polluted sediments. The lines of evidence considered were sediment chemistry, assessment of bioavailability, sub-lethal effects on biomarkers, and ecotoxicological bioassays. A conceptual and software-assisted model was developed with logical flow-charts elaborating results from each line of evidence on the basis of several chemical and biological parameters, normative guidelines or scientific evidence; the data are thus summarized into four specific synthetic indices, before their integration into an overall sediment hazard evaluation. This model was validated using European eels (Anguilla anguilla) as the bioindicator species, exposed under laboratory conditions to sediments from an industrial site, and caged under field conditions in two harbour areas. The concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trace metals were much higher in the industrial compared to harbour sediments, and accordingly the bioaccumulation in liver and gills of exposed eels showed marked differences between conditions seen. Among biomarkers, significant variations were observed for cytochrome P450-related responses, oxidative stress biomarkers, lysosomal stability and genotoxic effects; the overall elaboration of these data, as those of standard ecotoxicological bioassays with bacteria, algae and copepods, confirmed a higher level of biological hazard for industrial sediments. Based on comparisons with expert judgment, the model presented efficiently discriminates between the various conditions, both as individual modules and as an integrated final evaluation, and it appears to be a powerful tool to support more complex processes of environmental risk assessment.},

  abstract = {The need to use biomonitors representative of the sedimentary compartment has been recognized, particularly in estuaries. Thus, trace metal contamination has been monitored in an infaunal polychaete worm Nereis diversicolor and sediments in the Seine estuary and comparatively in the relatively clean Authie estuary (French coast of the English Channel) over two years taking samples every three months at both sites. No correlations were shown between total metal (Ag, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) concentrations in raw sediments and ragworms. Because these worms are known to be good biomonitors of the bioavailabilities of sedimentary trace metals, it follows that total sediment metal concentrations have a poor predictive ecotoxicological value. Using a correction factor to minimize the influence of weight, it is possible to make a good estimation of the average metal concentrations in a population of worms at a given site, sampling only a limited number of specimens. Metallothioneins are often considered to be good biomarkers of the presence of significant availabilities of trace metals. Metallothionein-like proteins (MTLPs) are present in N. diversicolor, but there is no significant relationship between MTLPs and metal concentrations. This situation might result from the importance of metal-containing granules, both extra- and intracellular, in ragworms.},

Metal-resistant animals exhibited a scope for growth that was 46–62\% less than that of animals from two non-resistant reference populations, corresponding to a mean metabolic cost of 1.31mJh−1mgDW−1. The resistant population also contained 13\% less lipid than animals from the reference populations and 73–81\% less carbohydrates. Consequently, mass-specific fecundity was reduced in resistant animals by 39–45\%, although material investment in individual gametes did not appear to vary. This demonstrates fitness costs associated with metal resistance in this ecologically important polychaete and adds to our understanding of phenotypic trade-offs associated with resistance.},

  abstract = {Climate change effects on marine ecosystems involve various stressors, predominantly temperature, hypoxia and CO2, all of which may combine with further anthropogenic stressors such as pollutants. All life forms respond to these drivers, following potentially common principles, which are insufficiently understood. Specific understanding may be most advanced in animals where the concept of ‘oxygen and capacity dependent thermal tolerance’ (OCLTT) is an integrator of various effects, linking molecular to ecosystem levels of biological organisation. Recent studies confirm OCLTT involvement in the field, causing changes in species abundance, biogeographical ranges, phenology and species predominance. At the whole-animal level, performance capacity set by aerobic scope and energy budget, building on baseline energy turnover, links fitness (within a thermal window) and functioning at the ecosystem level. In variable environments like the intertidal zone, animals also exploit their capacity for passive tolerance. While presently the temperature signal appears predominant in the field, effects may well involve other stressors, acting synergistically by narrowing the aerobic OCLTT window. Recent findings support the OCLTT concept as a common physiological basis linking apparently disjunct effects of ocean warming, acidification and hypoxia in a so-called climate syndrome. In brief, warming-induced CO2 accumulation in body fluids links to the effects of ocean acidification mediated by the weak acid distribution of CO2. Temperature-induced hypoxemia links to the hypoxia sensitivity of thermal tolerance. Future work will need to develop proxies for the temperature-dependent effects of climate-related stressors and also identify the principles operative in organisms other than animals and their underlying mechanisms. Mechanism-based modelling efforts are then needed to develop reliable organism to ecosystem projections of future change.},

  abstract = {Ever since its discovery 20 years ago, caspase-2 has been enigmatic and its function somewhat controversial. Although many in vitro studies suggested that caspase-2 was important for apoptosis, demonstrating an in vivo cell death role for this caspase has been more problematic, with caspase-2-deficient mice showing limited, tissue-specific cell death defects. Recent results from different laboratories suggest that at least one of its physiological roles in animals is to protect against cellular stress and transformation. As such, loss of caspase-2 augments tumorigenesis in some mouse models of cancer, assigning a tumour suppressor function to this enigmatic caspase. This review focuses on this seemingly non-apoptotic function of caspase-2 as a tumour suppressor and reconciles some of the recent findings in the field.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 (IRAK4) is considered as the most upstream kinase of IRAKs and plays a vital role in Toll-like receptor/Interleukin-1 receptor (TLR/IL-1R) signal transduction. In the present study, IRAK4 from thick shell mussel Mytilus coruscus (McIRAK4) was identified and characterized. McIRAK4 showed the most similarity to its counterparts in bivalves. The conserved death domain (DD) and catalytic domain of serine/threonine kinases (STKc) were predicted in all examined IRAK4s. McIRAK4 transcripts were constitutively expressed in all examined tissues with the higher expression level in immune related tissues, and were significantly induced in haemocytes upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) challenge. Further, the expression of McIRAK4 was obviously repressed by dsRNA mediated RNA interference (RNAi), meanwhile the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL17 were down-regulated while the antiinflammatory cytokine TGF-β was up-regulated. Additionally, McIRAK4 showed a global cytoplasmic localization in HEK293T cells through fluorescence microscopy. These results collectively indicated that McIRAK4 is one member of IRAK4 subfamily and might play the potential signal transducer role in inflammatory response. The present study provides supplement for TLR-mediated signaling pathway triggered by pathogenic invasions in thick shell mussel, and contributes to the clarification of the innate immune response in molluscs.},

However, urbanization and economic development in coastal areas have resulted in environmental problems globally. Due to coastal development such as new industrial facilities and commercial port expansion, anthropogenic metals are introduced to the adjacent areas. Therefore, metal pollution in coastal areas is one of the focused environmental concerns. Sediment quality in coastal zone reflects the long-term environmental status because it keeps a record of the development in the area. In this review paper, sediment metal concentrations in 52 selected sites worldwide are summarized for evaluation of the coastal environmental quality. The results from this study can be applied to science-based policy formulation and ecological restoration/rehabilitation practices in an integrated coastal zone environmental management.},

There is increased formation of arginine-derived hydroimidazolone adducts of proteins and guanosine-derived imidazopurinone adducts of DNA, linked to protein misfolding and mutagenesis, respectively. Methylglyoxal is a dominant mediator of dicarbonyl stress in vivo. It is metabolized by glutathione-dependent glyoxalase 1 (Glo1). The main drivers of dicarbonyl stress are increased formation of methylglyoxal by glycolytic overload and decreased metabolism of methylglyoxal by downregulation of Glo1. Proteins susceptible to dicarbonyl modification are enriched in protein folding, protein synthesis, and glucose metabolism. Dicarbonyl stress activates the unfolded protein response and downstream proinflammatory and prothrombotic responses. The pathobiology of dicarbonyl stress is most evident in obesity, vascular complications of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and aging. It may be corrected by dicarbonyl scavengers and inducers of Glo1 expression.},

The glutathione disulfide (GSSG) formed can be recycled to GSH by glutathione reductase in the presence of NADPH. The assay is composed of two parts: the preparation of cell cytosolic/tissue extracts and the detection of total glutathione (GSH and GSSG). The method is simple, convenient, sensitive and accurate. The lowest detection for GSH and GSSG is 0.103 nM in a 96-well plate. This method is rapid and the whole procedure takes no longer than 15 min including reagent preparation. The method can assay GSH in whole blood, plasma, serum, lung lavage fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, tissues and cell extracts and can be extended for drug discovery/pharmacology and toxicology protocols to study the effects of drugs and toxic compounds on glutathione metabolism.},

Routes for the uptake of heavy metals by marine invertebrates include uptake from solution and uptake from food. Metals associated with particles usually become available to marine invertebrates only after ingestion and digestion in the alimentary tract. Excretion of heavy metals from the bodies of marine invertebrates may also take place by a variety of routes. Relative rates of metal uptake and excretion are affected by features of the biology of the organism, including the permeability of external surfaces, and the nature of the food and its method of capture. Heavy metals are taken up passively by marine invertebrates even when external total metal concentrations are low. The concentrations of heavy metals in the bodies of marine invertebrates depend on the accumulation strategy adopted by each species for each metal.},

Crustaceans are used as examples of different accumulation patterns that will have a general applicability to all aquatic invertebrates. Toxicity is related to a threshold concentration of metabolically available metal and not to total accumulated metal concentration. The significance of accumulated metal concentrations is discussed in terms of the biological significance, including the attempted recognition of a high or low concentration, and of the applied use of aquatic invertebrates in biomonitoring programmes assessing geographical and temporal variation in trace metal bioavailabilities in aquatic systems.},

We investigated parameters of the bioaccumulation kinetics of the toxic metals Ag, Cd and Zn in populations of the estuarine polychaete worm Nereis diversicolor from differentially metal-contaminated sediments of 5 metal-rich estuaries in SW England and a relatively non-contaminated control estuary in SE England. One population (from Restronguet Creek, Cornwall) is known to be tolerant to raised availabilities of Zn and Cu. We compared uptake rate constants from solution (Ku) and assimilation efficiencies (AE) from sediment, and subsequent efflux rate constants (Ke) after uptake (from either water or ingested sediment) for each of the 3 metals among all populations. There was some limited interpopulation variation in the biodynamic parameters controlling bioaccumulation (and potential ecotoxicity) of trace metals between populations. There did not, however, appear to be consistent patterns to such variation. The basis of Zn tolerance in the Restronguet Creek population is not due to a reduction of Zn uptake from either solution or ingested sediment, or increased efflux of Zn accumulated after uptake from either route. The most likely mechanism is, therefore, an increased capacity for storage detoxification of Zn accumulated after regulation of Zn body concentration has broken down.},

The modelling employed previously measured physiological parameters of bioaccumulation—uptake rate constant, assimilation efficiency (AE) and efflux rate constants after uptake from water and sediment ingestion—and measured sediment metal concentrations specific for each population. AEs were considered to relate to metals in the organic component of the ingested sediment and ingestion rates were therefore expressed in these terms, with the further assumption that the total sediment metal concentration is a proxy for the metal concentration in the sediment organic component. A range of growth rate constants was extracted from the literature, as were concentration ranges of dissolved Ag, Cd and Zn in contaminated coastal waters. The model showed that {$>$}99\% Cd and {$>$}98\% Zn accumulated by N. diversicolor is derived from sediment ingestion; more bioaccumulated Ag is derived from solution, the percentage contribution of the dissolved source increasing from 46 to 80\% with an increase in Ag dissolved concentration from low to high values for coastal waters. Bioaccumulated metal concentrations predicted from the model generally showed excellent agreement with independently measured concentrations in field-collected worms, supporting the assumptions made in the model.},

Students were asked questions regarding sunscreen usage and demographic information, including age, race/ethnicity, and gender. Results: From 2007 to 2019, the average mean sunscreen usage for all students increased by 4\% between every consecutive year studied. Mean sunscreen usage among all racial groups studied, other than Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders, increased. Females were 92.7\% more likely to use sunscreen than males each year.~The mean sunscreen usage decreased by 5\% with an increase in a student’s age. Conclusions: Though overall sunscreen use in adolescents increased over the time period from 2007 to 2019, sunscreen use still remains limited due to a variety of factors possibly including cost, tanning, and different socio-cultural perceptions of sunscreen.},

The pre-formed radical monocation of 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS•+) is generated by oxidation of ABTS with potassium persulfate and is reduced in the presence of such hydrogen-donating antioxidants. The influences of both the concentration of antioxidant and duration of reaction on the inhibition of the radical cation absorption are taken into account when determining the antioxidant activity. This assay clearly improves the original TEAC assay (the ferryl myoglobin/ABTS assay) for the determination of antioxidant activity in a number of ways. First, the chemistry involves the direct generation of the ABTS radical monocation with no involvement of an intermediary radical. Second, it is a decolorization assay; thus the radical cation is pre-formed prior to addition of antioxidant test systems, rather than the generation of the radical taking place continually in the presence of the antioxidant. Hence the results obtained with the improved system may not always be directly comparable with those obtained using the original TEAC assay. Third, it is applicable to both aqueous and lipophilic systems.},

  abstract = {The effects of exposure to metals under and laboratory conditions were investigated in the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. The examined biological responses included the concentrations of heavy metals, the level of glutathione, and the activity of several enzymes selected among glutathione-dependent oxidoreductases and hydrolases: glutathione reductase. EC1.6.4.2; glyoxalase I, EC4.4.1.5; glyoxalase II, EC3.1.2.6; glutathione S-transferases, EC2.5.1.18; Se-dependent, EC1 11.1.9 and Se-independent, EC2.5.1.18 glutathione peroxidases; catalase, EC1.11.1.6; superoxide dismutase, EC1.15.1.1; alkaline phosphatase, EC3.1.3.1; cholinesterase, EC3.1.1.8; arylesterases, EC3.1.1.2. The analyses were carried out on digestive gland and gills of mussels from two populations, respectively from a polluted and a clean site. The same parameters were measured in control mussels transplanted to the polluted environment, and in molluscs exposed to copper under laboratory conditions. The comparison between different field and laboratory exposures was expected to give useful indications for a proper use of biochemical responses as biomarkers in monitoring trace metal pollution. Compared to control mussels, the polluted ones (native, transplanted and copper-exposed) showed significantly lower levels of glutathione and higher activities of the glyoxalases (which detoxify reactive α-ketoaldehydes formed in cellular oxidative processes). On the other hand, native mussels from both the polluted and control populations exhibited similar enzymatic activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, catalase, superoxide dismutase and alkaline phosphatase, whereas, in both transplanted and copper-exposed mussels, these enzymes showed significant variations. This finding could suggest the occurrence of some adaptation or compensatory mechanism in chronically polluted organisms. No clear results were obtained with glutathione S-transferases, whereas arylesterases and cholinesterases appeared not to be affected by metal pollution. From the results, three different kind of biological responses were identified and the implications for ecotoxicological studies discussed.},

  abstract = {Alpha-ketoaldehydes may be formed in cells during oxidative processes and glyoxalase I is the main enzyme involved in the detoxification pathway for these highly toxic compounds. Increased glyoxalase I activity has been observed in mussels exposed to high environmental levels of pollutants and a role for this enzyme as a protection mechanism against peroxidation damage has been hypothesized. In this paper, glyoxalase I from mussel tissue has been purified and a preliminary investigation of its molecular properties carried out. A two step purification procedure for glyoxalase I from digestive gland of Mytilus galloprovincialis is described. The pure enzyme is a 48 kDa protein with an heterodimeric quaternary structure composed of 24 and 25 kDa subunits. The isoelectric point of the native enzyme is at pH 5.0 and there is a divalent cation (probably Zn++) requirement for activity. The series of alkyl-S-glutathiones, from methyl- to decyl-, are competitive inhibitors of glyoxalase I. Ki values exponentially decrease from 1.15 mM to 2.65 μM with increasing chain length. Mussel glyoxalase I exhibits molecular properties similar to those of the mammalian enzyme. The possible role of glyoxalase I in the detoxification of α-ketoaldehydes formed during oxidative stress is discussed.},

  abstract = {A seasonal variability of trace metal concentrations and antioxidant enzymes was observed in gills and digestive gland of the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis from both a polluted and a nonpolluted population. Trace metals (As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn) exhibited, in both organs, maximum values in later winter–early spring followed by a progressive decrease during the summer. While in the gills this behavior probably reflects a different bioavailability of metals, in the digestive gland it is influenced mainly by the progressive infiltration of the organ by gonadic tissues during gametogenesis. Metals, as other pollutants, are known to influence the oxidative status of these organisms and antioxidant enzymes have been often proposed as biomarkers of exposure to contaminants. In this respect, it was of interest to compare the variations of these biochemical parameters with those of metal levels in two mussel populations from a polluted and a nonpolluted site, respectively. The biochemical parameters examined included the level of glutathione and the activity of the following glutathione dependent and antioxidant enzymes: glyoxalase I, EC 4.4.1.5; glyoxalase II, EC3.1.2.6; glutathione S-transferases, EC 2.5.1.18; glutathione reductase, EC 1.6.4.2; Se-dependent, EC 1.11.1.9 and Se-independent, EC 2.5.1.18 glutathione peroxidases; catalase, EC 1.11.1.6; superoxide dismutase, EC 1.15.1.1. Seasonal variations of trace metals did not appear to influence those of biochemical parameters, which generally showed an opposite trend with higher enzymatic activities in summer when trace metal concentrations were lower. The effects of metals on antioxidant enzymes were more evident when the two mussel populations were compared. In particular, organisms from the polluted site showed lower levels of glutathione and higher enzymatic activities of glyoxalase I even though the magnitude of these differences was not constant during the year. Moreover, native mussels from both the polluted and control populations exhibited limited differences in the activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, suggesting the possibility of some biochemical adaptation in organisms from chronically polluted environments.},

In the present paper, we describe the results obtained with caged mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, chosen as bioindicator organisms to detect variations of bioavailability and the early onset of molecular and cellular effects (biomarkers). Seven translocation experiments were carried out during the first year from the incident, with organisms deployed at 2 depths in 3 different sites. After 4–6 weeks, tissue concentrations were measured for the main classes of potentially released chemicals (trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile and aliphatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, halogenated pesticides, organotin compounds, brominated flame retardants, anionic surfactants); a wide battery of biomarkers covered responses indicative of exposure, detoxification, oxidative stress, cell damage and genotoxic effects. Results excluded serious contamination events or a consistent increase of environmental pollution although some episodic spills with reversible effects were detected. Data were elaborated within a quantitative weight of evidence (WOE) model which provided synthetic hazard indices for each typology of data, before their overall integration in an environmental risk index, which generally ranged from slight to moderate. The proposed WOE model was confirmed a useful tool to summarize large datasets of complex data in integrative indices, and to simplify the interpretation for stakeholders and decision makers, thus supporting a more comprehensive process of “site-oriented” management decisions.},

A bioassay-directed procedure was used to investigate cause–effect relationships between observed effects in acute laboratory bioassays (luminescent bacteria assay with Vibrio fischeri and embryo test with Danio rerio) and analyte concentrations in extracted samples. Brominated phenols and indoles—including 4-bromophenol; 2,4-dibromophenol; 4- and 6-bromoindole; 3,4-, 4,6-, and 3,6-dibromoindole; and tribrominated compounds—were identified in partly remarkable concentrations (up to 40,000 ng g−1 total organic carbon TOC for 4-bromophenol) in North Sea sediment samples and water samples (913 ng L−1 3,6-dibromoindole) from the German Bight. The toxicity of some of the identified brominated substances was low, with median effect concentration levels (EC50) ranging from 0.08 to 21.7 mg/L for V. fischeri and 4.3 to 46.3 mg/L for D. rerio. Comparison of the concentrations of analytes with ECs showed a toxicity contribution of brominated phenols and indoles to overall toxicity of the fraction. In the case of one water sample from the German Bight, brominated phenols and indoles accounted for the observed toxicity. Brominated phenols and indoles, which are assumed to be of biogenic origin, have rarely been discussed so far in the context of ecotoxicologic effects in marine ecosystems.},

Yet critical flaws in peer review, statistical methods, and publication procedures have rendered a shocking number of scientific studies useless-or worse, badly misleading. Drawing on surprising new data from "meta-science" (the science of how science works), Science Fictions documents the errors that have distorted our knowledge on issues as varied as cancer biology, nutrition, genetics, immigration, education, and extraterrestrial life. Stuart Ritchie's own work challenging an infamous psychology experiment helped spark what's now widely known as the "replication crisis," the realization that many supposed scientific truths cannot be relied upon. Now, he reveals the very human biases, mistakes, and deceptions that undermine the scientific endeavor: from contamination in science labs to the secret vaults of failed studies that nobody gets to see; from outright cheating with fake data to the more common but still ruinous temptation to exaggerate mediocre results for a shot at scientific fame. Yet Science Fictions is far from a counsel of despair. Rather, it's a defense of the scientific method against the pressures and perverse incentives that lead scientists to bend the rules. By illustrating the ways that science goes wrong, Ritchie gives us the knowledge we need to spot dubious research, and points the way to reforms that might save science from itself"--},

Thus, knowledge of riverine P inputs into the Baltic Sea is essential to evaluate the eutrophication level. In eutrophic estuaries such as the Warnow Estuary, the traditionally monitored parameters of total P (TP) and dissolved molybdate-reactive P (DRP) are not adequate for such an evaluation. Over two years (September 2016 to August 2018), an extended monitoring programme was applied in the Warnow Estuary, determining dissolved non-molybdate-reactive P (DNP), particulate molybdate-reactive P (PRP), and particulate non-molybdate-reactive P (PNP) in addition to TP and DRP. Within the estuary, the concentrations of the P fractions varied on both spatial and seasonal scales. While a gradient in the surface water's PNP was found towards the Baltic Sea, in the bottom water the DRP was distinctive. Particulate P fractions dominated the productive phases ({$>$}50\% of TP), whereas during regenerative periods dissolved P forms were dominant ({$>$}50\% of TP). Even though diffusive pore water flux estimates showed a release of dissolved P from the sediment, the calculated TP loads (44~t~TP a−1 in 2017) revealed a P retention of 12\% within the Warnow Estuary. Although the reduction targets of the Baltic Sea Action Plan are presumably able to reach, further reductions are necessary to achieve the aims (good status according to eutrophication) of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Water Framework Directive in the highly anthropogenically impacted Warnow Estuary.},

In addition, the use of a data-derived ‘optimal’ cutpoint leads to serious bias. We illustrate the impact of dichotomization of continuous predictor variables using as a detailed case study a randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis. Dichotomization of continuous data is unnecessary for statistical analysis and in particular should not be applied to explanatory variables in regression models.

We obserobserved that most of the LMW stress proteins built up in response to heat shock were different from those observed after cadmium exposure. Furthermore, Nereis, which resists high levels of cadmium, did not appear to synthesize metallothioneins, small proteins known to prevent cellular damage by sequestring toxic metal ions. As no cadmium-binding proteins were visualized on fluorograms, the mechanism by which Nereis resists cadmium injury remains to be disclosed.},

  abstract = {It is good scientific practice to the report an appropriate estimate of effect size and a confidence interval (CI) to indicate the precision with which a population effect was estimated. For comparisons of 2 independent groups, a probability-based effect size estimator (A) that is equal to the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve and closely related to the popular Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric statistical tests has many appealing properties (e.g., easy to understand, robust to violations of parametric assumptions, insensitive to outliers). We performed a simulation study to compare 9 analytic and 3 empirical (bootstrap) methods for constructing a CI for A that can yield very different CIs for the same data. The experimental design crossed 6 factors to yield a total of 324 cells representing challenging but realistic data conditions. Results were examined using several criteria, with emphasis placed on the extent to which observed CI coverage probabilities approximated nominal levels. Based on the simulation study results, the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method is recommended for constructing a CI for the A statistic; bootstrap methods also provided the least biased and most accurate standard error of A. An empirical illustration examining score differences on a citation-based index of scholarly impact across faculty at low-ranked versus high-ranked research universities underscores the importance of choosing an appropriate CI method.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Samples of the polychaete Nereis diversicolor O.F. Müller and surficial sediments from a clean and a polluted estuary were taken during a year at monthly intervals to determine, by comparison, the range of temporal fluctuations in trace metal concentrations. Whereas metal variations in surficial sediments were more pronounced in the polluted estuary, concentrations in N. diversicolor in both estuaries showed a wide range of temporal variation that surpassed that of surficial sediments. A clear decline in all metals studied (except Mn) from polluted sediments was noted after episodes of strong rainfall. In the reference estuary the fluctuations were less pronounced. Metal body burdens in N. diversicolor from the two estuaries were usually quite similar even though total levels in sediments differed considerably, indicating a lack of worm-sediment relationship. The low level of Cu, Cr and Pb in the tissues of N. diversicolor suggest a mechanism which prevents the polychaete from being exposed to these metals in highly polluted sediments. Therefore, it is concluded that N. diversicolor cannot be considered to be an ideal biomonitor of metal contamination in the polluted Bilbao Estuary.},

Moreover, a set of biomarkers including biotransformation enzymes, oxidative stress parameters, neurotoxicity and endocrine disruption markers was measured. The results allowed to determine biomarker variability due to fish gender or sampling season. For example, 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity, glutathione peroxidase as well as vitellogenin and spiggin exhibited strong gender differences. Conversely, lipoperoxidation and acethylcholinesterase activity were characterised by a lack of gender and seasonal variation, and can be considered as more robust parameters for a field application. The present work allowed to establish practical guideline for biomarker measurements in wild sticklebacks and to define a reference system which can be used to analyze variations in future monitoring studies.},

Tier II biomarkers should be detected in organisms exposed to a particular class of contaminants in their environment and be easily measured.

  abstract = {Increases in concentrations of greenhouse gases projected for the 21st century are expected to lead to increased mean global air and ocean temperatures. The National Assessment of Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change (NAST 2001) was based on a series of regional and sector assessments. This paper is a summary of the coastal and marine resources sector review of potential impacts on shorelines, estuaries, coastal wetlands, coral reefs, and ocean margin ecosystems. The assessment considered the impacts of several key drivers of climate change: sea level change; alterations in precipitation patterns and subsequent delivery of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment; increased ocean temperature; alterations in circulation patterns; changes in frequency and intensity of coastal storms; and increased levels of atmospheric CO2. Increasing rates of sea-level rise and intensity and frequency of coastal storms and hurricanes over the next decades will increase threats to shorelines, wetlands, and coastal development. Estuarine productivity will change in response to alteration in the timing and amount of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment delivery. Higher water temperatures and changes in freshwater delivery will alter estuarine stratification, residence time, and eutrophication. Increased ocean temperatures are expected to increase coral bleaching and higher CO2 levels may reduce coral calcification, making it more difficult for corals to recover from other disturbances, and inhibiting poleward shifts. Ocean warming is expected to cause poleward shifts in the ranges of many other organisms, including commercial species, and these shifts may have secondary effects on their predators and prey. Although these potential impacts of climate change and variability will vary from system to system, it is important to recognize that they will be superimposed upon, and in many cases intensify, other ecosystem stresses (pollution, harvesting, habitat destruction, invasive species, land and resource use, extreme natural events), which may lead to more significant consequences.},

The setting was two tertiary healthcare centres in South Africa. Participants were children with HIV aged 8 weeks and older. In total, 277 children were recruited and randomised to the intervention (n=139) or control treatment (n=138).1 The primary outcomes included the length of time after randomisation until death from any cause and the length of time after randomisation until the occurrence of tuberculosis. The initial results of the trial were reported after participants had been followed for a maximum of 500 days (median 5.7 months) During follow-up, mortality was significantly lower in the isoniazid group than in the placebo group (8\% (n=11) v 16\% (n=21); hazard ratio 0.46, 95\% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.95). Furthermore, the risk of tuberculosis was also significantly reduced in the isoniazid group (4\% (n=5) v 10\% (n=13); 0.28, 0.10 to 0.78).

This study shows applications of Rhizons for porewater sampling from sediments in aquatic systems and presents a newly developed Rhizon in situ sampler (RISS). With the inexpensive Rhizon sampling technique, porewater profiles can be sampled with minimum disturbance of both the sediment structure and possible flow fields. Field experiments, tracer studies, and numerical modeling were combined to assess the suitability of Rhizons for porewater sampling. It is shown that the low effort and simple application makes Rhizons a powerful tool for porewater sampling and an alternative to classical methods. Our investigations show that Rhizons are well suited for sampling porewater on board a ship, in a laboratory, and also for in situ sampling. The results revealed that horizontally aligned Rhizons can sample porewater with a vertical resolution of 1 cm. Combined with an in situ benthic chamber system, the RISS allows studies of benthic fluxes and porewater profiles at the same location on the seafloor with negligible effect on the incubated sediment water interface. Results derived by porewater sampling of sediment cores from the Southern Ocean (Atlantic sector) and by in situ sampling of tidal flat sediments of the Wadden Sea (Sahlenburg/Cuxhaven, Germany) are presented.},

  abstract = {Organic-poor, permeable quartz sands are often present at land-sea transition zones in coastal regions. Yet, the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, sulfur, and iron are not well studied here. The aim of this work was, therefore, to improve our understanding regarding the chemical processes in these prominent coastal sediments. A 10\,m core was collected at a dune base of the barrier island Spiekeroog, Germany, for this purpose. Additionally, groundwater was sampled from a multi-level well for one year to record seasonal hydrochemical variations. Methods included the analyses of geochemical (total carbon, total inorganic carbon, reactive iron, total sulfur, reduced inorganic sulfur) and hydrochemical parameters (field parameters, major ions, DOC, and molecular compositions of DOM), as well as stable sulfur isotopes (δ34S-sulfate, -sulfide, -total reduced inorganic sulfur). Moreover, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was applied. Results show that the core sediments are very young ({$<$}500 a) and were rapidly deposited. They are characterized by remarkably low contents of organic carbon ({$<$}0.1\% dw.), reactive iron (\textasciitilde 10\,mmol/kg), and iron sulfides ({$<$}3\,mmol/kg). Groundwater salinities were low in the top core sediments and increased at depth during most times of the year. However, the sampling site is subject to (seasonally) varying salinities, which could be linked to the biogeochemical cycles. For instance, the infiltration of seawater-derived labile DOM during inundation events drives microbial respiration besides sedimentary organic matter. Oxygen and nitrate were the dominant electron acceptors for the decomposition of organic matter in near-surface groundwater, while sulfate reduction was constrained to the lower brackish sediments. Here, authigenic pyrite formation was inferred based on the detection of dissolved sulfide, intact pyrite framboids, and matching stable sulfur isotope signatures of dissolved and solid sulfides. We concluded that the extremely low organic carbon contents limit pyrite formation in the organic-poor, permeable quartz sands.},

Despite the increasing number of studies addressing the impact of macro- and microplastics on biota, there is still a significant knowledge gap regarding the effects of nanoplastics alone and in combination with other contaminants. Among the aquatic contaminants that may interact with nanoplastics is arsenic (As), a metalloid found in estuarine and coastal ecosystems, pernicious to benthic organisms. This study aimed to understand how a parental pre-exposure to 100~nm polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs) would influence the response of Hediste diversicolor to exposure to arsenic in terms of behaviour, neurotransmission, antioxidant defences and oxidative damage, and energy metabolism. The obtained data revealed an increase in burrowing time and a significant inhibition in cholinesterase activity in all polychaetes exposed to As, regardless of the pre-exposure to PS NPs. Oxidative status was altered particularly in parentally exposed organisms, with damage detected in terms of lipid peroxidation at 50~μg/L and protein carbonylation at 50 and 250~μg As/L exposed organisms when compared to control. Overall, data shows that parental pre-exposure to plastics influences the response of aquatic organisms, increasing their susceptibility to other contaminants. Thus, more studies should be performed with other environmental contaminants, to better understand the potential increased risk associated with the presence of nanoplastics to aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The equilibration and bioavailability of metals in laboratory-contaminated sediments have been investigated in order to provide better guidance on acceptable procedures for spiking sediments with metals for use in the development of whole-sediment toxicity tests. The equilibration rates of Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn spiked into three estuarine surface sediments with varying properties were investigated. Changes to sediment pH, redox potential, porewater and acid-soluble metals, acid-volatile sulfide and bacterial activity during equilibration, effects of temperature and disturbances following equilibration are reported. The addition of metals to sediments caused major decreases in pH and increases in redox potential as metals displaced iron(II) into the porewaters and added metals and iron (following oxidation) were hydrolyzed. The rates of equilibration of metals in porewaters varied considerably and were dependent on sediment and metal properties. For the oxic/sub-oxic sediments studied, metal-spikes of Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn appeared near equilibrium after 25–45, 10–15, 30–70 and 20–40 days, respectively. Acid-soluble metal concentrations decreased during the equilibration period indicating that the metals become more strongly associated with the sediments with time (less bioavailable). Bacterial activity was greatest in the sediment equilibrated at pH 7 and decreased following the addition of metals. During the equilibration period, bacterial activity increased in sediments equilibrated at pH 6, remained low in sediments at pH 8 and varied erratically in sediments at pH 7. Spiked sediments were shown to equilibrate more slowly at lower temperatures resulting in high porewater metal concentrations. Disturbances to equilibrated sediments because of sample manipulation caused significant iron(II) oxidation and losses of metals from porewaters. The importance of documenting spiking and equilibration procedures and carefully measuring and reporting sediment parameters is highlighted so that contaminant bioavailability and exposure pathways can be interpreted and organism sensitivity accurately determined. Recommendations are given for the preparation of metal-spiked sediments for toxicity testing purposes.},

  abstract = {A major weakness of sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) is their poor ability to predict how toxicity thresholds change for different sediment types. Using species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) of copper effects data, new guidelines were derived for copper in non-sulfidic marine sediments in which organic carbon (OC) and particle size strongly influence copper bioavailability. The derived SQGs varied in a predictable manner with changes in sediment particle size and organic carbon (OC), and were shown to offer a significant improvement on the existing ‘single value’ SQG. Adequate protection for all benthic organisms is expected to be achieved for a OC-normalised copper concentration of 3.5mgCug−1 OC in the {$<$}63μm sediment fraction. For short-term exposures, the equivalent acute guideline is 11mg{$<$}63μmCug−1 OC. The new SQGs incorporate a high degree of conservatism owing to the use of copper-spiked sediments and laboratory-based bioassays that were expected to result in greater metal exposure of organisms to bioavailable copper than would be expected for field-contaminated sediments with similar total copper concentrations. SQGs that vary with sediment properties were prepared in an easily referenced tabular format.},

We argue that conceptual clarity is enhanced by adopting restricted definitions of “niche” that enable operational definitions of basic concepts like fundamental, potential, and realized niches and potential and actual distributional areas. We apply these definitions to the question of niche conservatism, addressing what it is that is conserved and showing with a quantitative example how niche change can be measured. In this example, we display the extremely irregular structure of niche space, arguing that it is an important factor in understanding niche evolution. Many cases of apparently successful models of distributions ignore biotic factors: we suggest explanations to account for this paradox. Finally, relating the probability of observing a species to ecological factors, we address the issue of what objects are actually calculated by different niche modeling algorithms and stress the fact that methods that use only presence data calculate very different quantities than methods that use absence data. We conclude that the results of niche modeling exercises can be interpreted much better if the ecological and mathematical assumptions of the modeling process are made explicit.},

The thermal environment plays a direct role in the distribution and survival of marine ectotherms through the temperature-dependent effects on their physiology, as well as indirectly by affecting the organism’s susceptibility to other biotic and abiotic stressors. We review studies that have investigated the effects of temperature and anthropogenic pollution by trace metals, with a focus on metabolic regulation as a major mechanism that underlies the interactive effects of temperature and metals on the physiology and survival of ectotherms. These studies suggest that impairment of energy metabolism plays a key role in the synergistic effects of these stressors, and we elaborate a mechanistic framework for understanding these interactions. Furthermore, the present study seeks to provide an impetus for future investigations in order to define more precisely the physiological mechanisms and functional properties of temperature–pollution interactions.},

  abstract = {Energy balance is a fundamental requirement of stress adaptation and tolerance. We explore the links between metabolism, energy balance and stress tolerance using aquatic invertebrates as an example and demonstrate that using key parameters of energy balance (aerobic scope for growth, reproduction and activity; tissue energy status; metabolic rate depression; and compensatory onset of anaerobiosis) can assist in integrating the effects of multiple stressors and their interactions and in predicting the whole-organism and population-level consequences of environmental stress. We argue that limitations of both the amount of available energy and the rates of its acquisition and metabolic conversions result in trade-offs between basal maintenance of a stressed organism and energy costs of fitness-related functions such as reproduction, development and growth and can set limit to the tolerance of a broad range of environmental stressors. The degree of stress-induced disturbance of energy balance delineates transition from moderate stress compatible with population persistence (pejus range) to extreme stress where only time-limited existence is possible (pessimum range). It also determines the predominant adaptive strategy of metabolic responses (energy compensation vs. conservation) that allows an organism to survive the disturbance. We propose that energy-related biomarkers can be used to determine the conditions when these metabolic transitions occur and thus predict ecological consequences of stress exposures. Bioenergetic considerations can also provide common denominator for integrating stress responses and predicting tolerance limits under the environmentally realistic scenarios when multiple and often variable stressors act simultaneously on an organism. Determination of bioenergetic sustainability at the organism's level (or lack thereof) has practical implications. It can help identify the habitats and/or conditions where a population can survive (even if at the cost of reduced reproduction and growth) and those that are incapable of supporting viable populations. Such an approach will assist in explaining and predicting the species' distribution limits in the face of the environmental change and informing the conservation efforts and resource management practices.},

  abstract = {Integrating the effects of multiple stressors and predicting their consequences for the species’ survival and distribution is an important problem in ecological physiology. This review applies the concept of energy-limited tolerance to stress to develop bioenergetic markers that can assist in integrating the effects of multiple stressors and distinguishing between the moderate stress compatible with long-term survival of populations and bioenergetically unsustainable extreme stress. These markers reflect the progressive decline of the aerobic scope of an organism (defined as the fraction of the energy flux and metabolic power supporting this flux available after the basal maintenance costs of an organism are met) with increasing levels of the environmental stress. During the exposure to moderate stress (i.e., in the pejus range of the environmental conditions), the aerobic scope is positive but reduced compared with the optimum conditions. The reduction of the metabolic scope can be due to the (1) elevated costs of basal metabolism, (2) activation of the mechanisms for protection and damage repair, (3) reduced assimilation of food, and/or (4) stress-induced impacts on the aerobic pathways producing ATP. This leads to suboptimal growth and reproductive rates in the pejus range of environmental conditions and is commonly observed in food-limited and energy-limited wild populations. The tolerance windows of the organisms are delimited by the pessimum range(s) of environmental conditions in which the aerobic scope of the organism disappears (so that all available energy and metabolic capacity are used in support of basal metabolism), energy resources are depleted, and partial anaerobiosis and/or metabolic rate depression set in. The habitats where environmental conditions remain in the pessimum zone long enough to prevent consistent growth and reproduction often coincide with the species’ distributional limits. Thus, focus on the bioenergetic effects of environmental stressors and their immediate consequences for fitness provides a suitable framework for integrating physiology and functional ecology and can assist in understanding the driving forces and limitations of environmental adaptation and improving assessment of ecological risk as well as environmental management in field populations facing multiple stressors.},

Metabolic rates define the physiological and life-history performance of an organism, have direct implications for Darwinian fitness, and affect ecologically relevant traits such as the trophic relationships, productivity and ecosystem engineering functions. Natural environmental variability and anthropogenic changes expose aquatic ectotherms to multiple stressors that can strongly affect their energy metabolism and thereby modify the energy fluxes within an organism and in the ecosystem. This Review focuses on the role of bioenergetic disturbances and metabolic adjustments in responses to multiple stressors (especially the general cellular stress response), provides examples of the effects of multiple stressors on energy intake, assimilation, conversion and expenditure, and discusses the conceptual and quantitative approaches to identify and mechanistically explain the energy trade-offs in multiple stressor scenarios, and link the cellular and organismal bioenergetics with fitness, productivity and/or ecological functions of aquatic ectotherms.},

N. diversicolor was present in 6 sampling sites whereas S. plana in 4 of them. The aim of our study was to relate several pollution biomarkers to chemical sources (metals and organic pollutants e.g. PCB, PAH) in these species, thereby confirming their adequacy as sentinels for this habitat. The biomarkers surveyed in the two invertebrates were the activities of the antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT), the phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the neurotoxicity marker acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Metallothionein (MT) levels were measured as a biomarker of exposure to metals. The results suggested a different response in the two sediment-dwelling organisms, the sediment-eating polychaete and the water-filtering clam, probably as a consequence of different contamination exposures. The results also suggested that samples from the “Caño Sancti-Petri” were exposed to biologically active compounds that altered some of their biochemical responses. Of all the biomarkers tested, AChE was the most sensitive one and N. diversicolor the potentially most robust sentinel in this ecosystem. In this low to moderately polluted environment, the biochemical approach better reflected temporal trends than site-related differences although it was also able to detect punctual chemical insults.},

Results revealed that exposure to both concentrations of CAL increased significantly mortality rate in the cells of haemolymph and digestive gland, while digestive gland cells were no longer able to regulate cell volume. Exposure significantly reduced haemolymph parameters (Cl−, Na+), affected the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase of digestive gland and catalase of gill, and caused also histopathological alterations in digestive gland and gills. Main histological damages detected in mussels were lipofuscin accumulation, focal points of necrosis, mucous overproduction and infiltrative inflammations. Interestingly, alterations persisted after the recovery period in CAL-free water, especially for haemocyte parameters (K+, Na+, Ca2+, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose). A slight recovery of histological conditions was detected. These findings suggested that sub-chronic exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide caused significant alterations in both cell and tissue parameters of M. galloprovincialis. Considering the ecologically and commercially important role of mussels in coastal waters, a potential risk posed by neonicotinoids to this essential aquatic resource can be highlighted.},

Spiking methods compared stirring and shaking of selenite with sediments followed by toxicity testing from 4 to 72 h. The two methods produced similar LC50 values; however, significant toxicity changes occurred over time. The effect of mixing spiked sediments from 0.5 to 48 h showed decreased toxicity after 24 and 48 h of shaking. Storage of selenite-spiked sediments at 4 and 25°C revealed significant differences in LC50 values between storage temperatures and with time of storage. Toxicity tended to decrease faster in sediments stored at 25°C. Sediment: water comparisons varied the volume of sediment and water used in test beakers and the sediment surface area. In general, only extreme sediment: water ratios affected survival. Varying the sediment surface area while maintaining a constant 1:4 ratio did not alter survival. An increased surface area and a decreased sediment: water ratio (1:8) decreased survival.},

This study aimed to clarify whether chronic (56 d) exposure to a mixture of environmentally relevant concentrations of contaminants (tributyltin [TBT] and perfluorononanoic acid [PFNA]) spiked in clean sediment would affect the sediment-dwelling polychaete Hediste diversicolor. Endpoints were burial time, biomass change, and cellular energy allocation (CEA). Sediments were spiked with these two contaminants to produce different levels of contamination. Chemical analyses of the sediment following the exposure indicated that the spiking procedure was only partially successful and treatments were grouped into four categories according to contaminant concentrations: “background,” “low,” “moderate,” and “high.” No significant differences were found between treatments with respect to burial time, biomass change, or energy storage fractions (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) in the polychaetes. A significant increase in cellular respiration was found for polychaetes in “moderate” and “high” treatment groups compared to the “background” treatment group. This resulted in significantly lower cellular energy allocation values for “moderate” and “high” treatment groups compared to “background.” Although the effects were not marked, the results show that sediment-dwelling organisms may be affected following chronic exposure to environmental contaminants.

For a 10-d exposure to Cu-spiked sediments, toxicity to the amphipod Melita plumulosa was demonstrated to occur through a combination of dissolved and dietary Cu exposure pathways, but for the bivalves Spisula trigonella and Tellina deltoidalis, toxicity occurred primarily by exposure to dissolved Cu. For relatively oxidized sediments that had moderate amounts of organic carbon (2.6–8.3\% OC), silt (20–100\% {$<$}63-µm particles) but low acid-volatile sulfide (AVS), acute toxicity thresholds for the three species were derived based on the OC-normalized Cu concentration of the less than 63-µm sediment fraction. For all three species, no effects were observed at concentrations below 10 µg/L dissolved Cu (in pore water and overlying water) or below 12 mg Cu/g OC (for {$<$}63 µm sediment). For sediments with silt/OC properties of 20/0.5, 50/1, or 70/4\%, the particulate Cu-based threshold equated to 60, 120, or 480 mg Cu/kg, respectively. For oxic/suboxic sediments in which AVS is not limiting metal availability, sediment quality guidelines of this form will provide adequate protection against toxicity and improve the prediction of effects for sediments with varying properties.

The latter linker subunits are essential for the assembly of the other heme-containing subunits, monomers and a trimer. The cDNA encoding the linker chain L2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of 235 residues has been determined. The sequence showed 22–75\% identity with other linker chains. All of the linker sequences examined so far have a highly conserved cysteine-rich segment at positions 89–130: Xaa3-Cys-Xaa6-Cys-Xaa6-Cys-Xaa6-Cys-Asp-Gly-Xaa2-Asp-Cys-Xaa4-Asp-Glu-Xaa4-Cys, and the motif corresponds exactly to the cysteine-rich repeats of the ligand-binding domains of vertebrate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (Suzuki, T. and Riggs, A.F. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 13548–13555). A 287 bp intron interrupts the coding sequence of Neanthes L2 gene just at the N-terminal boundary of this motif, and the position of the splice junction was exactly conserved in Neanthes and Lumbricus linker genes. This suggests that the intron has been conserved for at least 450 million years in annelid linker genes. The evolutionary origin of the remaining parts of linker chains is unclear, but it is noteworthy that the topology of the two intrachain disulfide bridges in the C-terminal segment of linker chains is homologous with that of the carbohydrate-recognition domain of animal C-type lectin.},

Exposures to CuAq and CuOMicro caused mortality (62.5 and 37.5\%, respectively), whereas mean burrowing time increased during exposure to CuAq and CuONP from 0.12~h (controls) to 19.3 and 12.2~h, respectively. All Cu treatments bioaccumulated, especially CuAq (up to 4 times more than the other treatments). Cu was roughly equally distributed among the five subcellular fractions in controls and worms exposed to CuONP or CuOMicro. In contrast, ≈50\% of accumulated Cu in CuAq exposed worms was found in metal rich granules and significantly more Cu was present in heat-denatured proteins and organelles than in worms exposed to CuOMicro or in controls. Our results suggest that Cu form affects its bioaccumulation and subsequent toxicity and detoxification in a polychaete like N.~diversicolor.},

Its principal critique concerns the lack of independence in flawed experimental designs and the use of inferential statistics to test the hypothesis of such experiments. Thirty years after its appearance, it remains misunderstood by many researchers, including ecotoxicologists. In the present study, we try to clarify some of its concepts by filling in what seems to be a gap in the terminology of manipulative experiments. We propose the term “experimental medium” to refer strictly to the relevant spatial scale of the experiment to preserve the specificity of the experimental and observational units and to display pseudoreplication as a kind of misinterpretation and/or misanalysis of inferential statistics. A classification of the types of experimental designs in ecotoxicology is offered, and the problems in using inferential statistics in suboptimal designs are discussed. We hope to shed some light on such a classic topic for ecotoxicologists. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:2868–2874. © 2017 SETAC},

We studied sedimentological and faunal controls of benthic organic matter mineralization, a crucial ecosystem process provided for by sediments of shelf seas. Subtidal benthic habitats representative of the wide permeability gradient found in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (Northeast Atlantic Shelf) were characterized in terms of sediment descriptors, macrofauna, and sediment biogeochemistry was estimated. Our results confirmed a strong correlation between sediment characteristics and macrofauna, and estimated sediment biogeochemical process rates were clearly linked to both. Results of variance partitioning and statistical modelling showed that oxic mineralization and nitrification were mainly regulated by faunal activities whereas anoxic mineralization was regulated by sediment properties, with permeability as a decisive factor. Both biotic and abiotic factors were needed to explain variability in oxygen consumption and total mineralization estimates, suggesting that macrofaunal activities have different effects across habitats. The statistical models were a useful tool to interpret the impact of anthropogenic activities in the study area and represent a step towards predicting the effects of human activities on crucial ecosystem functions.},

  abstract = {Warming environments can alter the outcome of host–parasite relationships with important consequences for biodiversity. Warming often increases disease risk, and interactions with other environmental factors can intensify impacts by modifying the underlying mechanisms, such as host immunity. In coastal ecosystems, metal pollution is a pervasive stressor that influences disease and immunity in many organisms. Despite the crisis facing coral reefs, which stems in part from warming-associated disease outbreaks, the impacts of metal pollutants on scleractinian and octocoral disease are largely unknown. We investigated how warming oceans and copper pollution affect host immunity and disease risk for two diseases of the abundant Caribbean octocoral, the sea fan Gorgonia ventalina. Field surveys across a sediment copper concentration gradient in Puerto Rico, USA revealed that cellular immunity of sea fans increased by 12.6\% at higher sediment copper concentrations, while recovery from multifocal purple spots disease (MFPS) tended to decrease. MFPS severity in the field increased at warmer sites. In a controlled laboratory experiment, sea fans were inoculated with live cultures of a labyrinthulid parasite to test the interactive effects of temperature and copper on immune activation. As in the field, higher copper induced greater immunity, but the factorial design of the experiment revealed that copper and temperature interacted to modulate the immune response to the parasite: immune cell densities increased with elevated temperature at lower copper concentrations, but not with high copper concentrations. Tissue damage was also greater in treatments with higher copper and warmer temperatures. Field and lab evidence confirm that elevated copper hinders sea fan immune defenses against damaging parasites. Temperature and copper influenced host–pathogen interactions in octocorals by modulating immunity, disease severity, and disease recovery. This is the first evidence that metal pollution affects processes influencing disease in octocorals and highlights the importance of immune mechanisms in environmentally mediated disease outbreaks. Although coral conservation efforts must include a focus on global factors, such as rapid warming, reducing copper and other pollutants that compromise coral health on a local scale may help corals fight disease in a warming ocean.},

This report gives an overview of the species of benthic metazoans used for the assessment of toxicity in freshwater and marine sediments, as well as of the criteria relevant to the choice between test species and procedures. The main applications of these organisms are mono-species bioassays, test-batteries, analyses of benthic communities and bioaccumulation studies. Sediment toxicity assays, including acute and chronic exposures, have been developed for nematodes, insects, oligochaetes, polychaetes, crustaceans, molluscs and echinoderms. At least 30 species of freshwater and 71 species of marine and estuarine benthic metazoans have thus far been used in sediment toxicity bioassays. Although aquatic pollution is a world-wide problem, most sediment toxicity bioassays have been developed for organisms native to Europe and North America. The most common bioassay endpoints are mortality, development, growth and behavioural responses. The value of genetic, biochemical, physiological and pathological responses as toxicity endpoints is currently being investigated. The quest for additional test species and protocols is still a worthwhile endeavour in sediment ecotoxicology.},

  abstract = {Roles for cell death in development, homeostasis, and the control of infections and cancer have long been recognized. Although excessive cell damage results in passive necrosis, cells can be triggered to engage molecular programs that result in cell death. Such triggers include cellular stress, oncogenic signals that engage tumor suppressor mechanisms, pathogen insults, and immune mechanisms. The best-known forms of programmed cell death are apoptosis and a recently recognized regulated necrosis termed necroptosis. Of the two best understood pathways of apoptosis, the extrinsic and intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways, the former is induced by the ligation of death receptors, a subset of the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily. Ligation of these death receptors can also induce necroptosis. The extrinsic apoptosis and necroptosis pathways regulate each other and their balance determines whether cells live. Integral in the regulation and initiation of death receptor-mediated activation of programmed cell death is the aspartate-specific cysteine protease (caspase)-8. This review describes the role of caspase-8 in the initiation of extrinsic apoptosis execution and the mechanism by which caspase-8 inhibits necroptosis. The importance of caspase-8 in the development and homeostasis and the way that dysfunctional caspase-8 may contribute to the development of malignancies in mice and humans are also explored.},

This mixed-ligand complex with caf as the secondary ligand has the ratio of metal: ligand1: ligand2: ligand3 is 1:1:2:2 and has the formula [Cu(byp)(Caf)2(SCN)2] (denoted as Complex A). Structure of Complex A was established from the UV spectra, FTIR, mass and the thermal analysis data. The donor sites of the ligands were ascertained from the changes in the values of ν(SCN) of thiocyanate, ν(C − N1) of bypyridine, ν(C − O) of carboxylic and ν(C − N9) of caffeine. Complex A has shown potential SOD-like activity as a good antioxidant agent and with that it shows in-vitro antibacterial efficiency and anti-cancer activity against colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) and breast cancer (Mcf-7) cell lines. The present study confirms that Complex A has immense potential as an effective cytotoxic agent against human colorectal adenocarcinoma and breast cancer diseases. Volcanic ash exposure can lead to significant health risks. Damage to the respiratory and pulmonary systems are the most evident toxic side effects although the causes of these symptoms remain unclear. Conversely, the effects on other organs remain largely under-explored, limiting our understanding of the long-term volcanic ash-related risk at the whole-body scale. The metallome i.e. metal concentrations and isotopic compositions within the body, is suspected to be affected by volcanic ash exposure, having thus the potential for capturing some specificities of ash toxicity. However, the means by and extent to which the metallome is affected at the entire body scale and how the consequent chemical and isotopic deregulations correlate with pathophysiological dysfunctions are currently poorly understood. Here, we adopt a transdisciplinary approach combining high precision chemical analyses (major and trace element concentrations) and CuZn isotope measurements in seven organs and two biological fluids of isogenic mice (C57BL/6) exposed to eruption products from La Soufrière de Guadeloupe (Eastern Carribean), in tandem with biological parameters including physiological and morphological data. Based on principal component analysis, we show that after one month of exposure to volcanic ash deposits, the mice metallome; originally organ-specific and isotopically-typified, is highly disrupted as shown for example by heavy metal accumulation in testis (e.g., Fe, Zn) and Cu, Zn isotopic divergence in liver, intestine and blood. These metallomic variations are correlated with early testicular defects and might reflect the warning signs of premature (entero)hepatic impairments that may seriously affect fertility and favor the emergence of liver diseases after prolonged exposure. Monitoring the temporal evolution of the Cu and Zn isotope compositions seems to be a promising technique to identify the main biological processes and vital functions that are vulnerable to environmental volcanogenic pollutants although this will require further validation on human subjects. With the interest in radiometal-containing diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals increasing rapidly, appropriate ligands to coordinate completely and stably said radiometals is essential. Reported here are two novel, bis(amido)bis(oxinate)diamine ligands, H2amidohox (2,2′-(ethane-1,2-diylbis(((8-hydroxyquinolin-2-yl)methyl)azanediyl))diacetamide) and H2amidoC3hox (2,2′-(propane-1,3-diylbis(((8-hydroxyquinolin-2-yl)methyl)azanediyl))diacetamide), that combine two 8-hydroxyquinoline and amide donor groups and differ by one carbon in their 1,2-ethylenediamine vs. 1,3-diaminopropane backbones, respectively. Both ligands have been thoroughly studied via metal complexation, solution thermodynamics and radiolabeling with three radiometal ions: [nat/64Cu]Cu2+, [nat/111In]In3+, and [nat/203Pb]Pb2+. X-ray crystallography determined the structures of the hexacoordinated Cu2+-ligand complexes, indicating a better fit of Cu2+ to the H2amidohox binding pocket. Concentration dependent radiolabeling with [64Cu]Cu2+ was successfully quantitative as low as 1 μM with H2amidohox and 10 μM with H2amidoC3hox within 5 min at room temperature. However, [64Cu][Cu(amidohox)] maintained higher kinetic inertness against a superoxide dismutase enzyme-challenge assay and ligand challenges compared to the [64Cu][Cu(amidoC3hox)] counterpart. Similarly, H2amidohox had significantly higher radiochemical conversion with both [111In]In3+ (97\% at 1 μM) and [203Pb]Pb2+ (97\% at 100 μM) under mild conditions compared to H2amidoC3hox (76\% with [111In]In3+ at 1 μM and 0\% with [203Pb]Pb2+). By studying non-radioactive and radioactive complexation with both ligands, a comprehensive understanding of the coordination differences between two- and three‑carbon diamine backbones is discussed. Overall, the ethylenediamine backbone of H2amidohox proves to be superior in rapid, mild radiolabeling and kinetic inertness towards competing ligands and proteins. A moderately fluorescence active Schiff base chemosensor (E)-4-Chloro-2-(((2-(perazine-1-yl)ethyl)imino)methyl)phenol (HL), based on piperazine platform, has been fabricated for selective, easy, colorimetric detection of two metal ions Cu(II) and Zn(II) and one anion F− among several competitive cations and anions. Impressively under UV light (λ = 365 nm) the decent luminance property of HL is found to be more intensified after introduction of Zn(II) and a separate deep green colour is developed after addition of F−. But interestingly the luminescence color of the of HL becomes colorless after addition of Cu(II). The results analysis of fluorescence life time measurement, mass and NMR spectral study, the detector-probe binding constant values provide authentic hints regarding the bond formation among the chemosensor and recognized cations and anion. By implementing the Density Functional Theory (DFT) the structures of the host–guest complexes have been theoretically optimized. The bio sensing activity of HL has been confirmed by implementing the fluorescence live cell imaging study for Zn(II) sensing. By utilizing the presence of reversibility in Zn(II) sensing the molecular logic gate formation has been carried out. Finally the sensing phenomena of the chemosensor for effective F− ion detection are further utilized to detect this anion in drinking water. Dermatologists play a critical role in diagnosing and managing nutritional deficiencies as they often present with cutaneous findings. Traditionally, nutritional dermatoses are taught in the context of developing countries, famine, population displacement, and poor health care access; however, in the United States, common risk factors include chronic liver disease, alcoholism, psychiatric disease, bariatric surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, and hemodialysis. Additionally, nutritional dermatoses may be underdiagnosed in the United States and result in increased morbidity and utilization of hospital resources. There is a need for providers in developed nations to identify these deficiencies, and this review aims to meet that practice gap and provide relevant context to these diseases for dermatologists. This 2-part review series will focus on the epidemiology, impact, appearance, and diagnostic modalities for micronutrient deficiencies, including zinc, selenium, copper, and vitamins A and C in part 1. The companion review will focus on the B-complex vitamins. The synthesis, structure and properties of copper(II) perchlorate complexes with antipyrine (AP), [Cu(AP)4(H2O)](ClO4)2 and [Cu(AP)5](ClO4)2, are described and compared with those of alternative compounds containing different AP ligands.},

  abstract = {Graphene is a promising material with a wide range of future applications that could potentially lead to its transfer from numerous water and terrestrial sources to the sea, thus fate and effects of graphene in the marine ecosystem deserve attention. Within this work, the impact of the short- and long-term exposure (36~h and 24 days) of the marine benthic polychaete Hediste diversicolor to various concentrations (36~h: 0.4, 4, 40 and 400~mg~L−1; 24 days: 4 and 40~mg~L−1) of the pristine graphene multilayer nanoflakes (of thickness 8–12~nm) was investigated. Experiments revealed a limited toxic effect of graphene on H.~diversicolor. Although the polychaetes ingested graphene, no impact on their total energy content was found. The toxic effect expressed by significant elevation of catalase activity indicating activation of defence mechanisms was recorded but only at the early stage of exposure. Activities of other antioxidant and cellular damage biomarkers (SOD, GST, GSH, MDA, CBO) remained unaffected. Moreover, no neurotoxic effect expressed by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was observed. Substantial inter-individual variability in the activities of some biomarkers at the end of the long-term experiment was found. Polychaetes were buried deeper in the sediment with graphene than in the controls indicating an escape reaction and avoidance behaviour. The latter may lead to the transfer of graphene from the sediment surface to deeper sediment layers with unknown consequences for the benthic ecosystem.},

Hediste diversicolor is a widespread species in coastal marine sediments. It plays key ecological functions mostly related to bioturbation process which means sediment reworking due to the worm burrowing activity and building a network of galleries. Herein, we show that commercial plastic microspheres of two sizes (63–75 and 300–355~μm) have the potential to cause neurotoxicity in H. diversicolor. The whole-body acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity – a common indicator of neurotoxic effect - was on average 60\% lower in polychaetes exposed for 28 days to MPs served at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.08\% sediment d. wt.), than in unexposed ones. Significantly reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GST) indicated suppression of the cellular antioxidative system in worms exposed to MPs. No changes were, however, observed in tGSH, lipid or protein oxidation measures (CBO, MDA), and in the energetic value of these polychaetes. The response was generally similar with no regard to MPs size. Only very few microspheres were found in polychaetes exposed to MPs spiked sediment. The potential role of MPs-associated pollutants as a factor responsible for observed biochemical effects, is discussed.},

  abstract = {This study explores the relation between sediment composition and intertidal macrobenthos populations in the Zwin nature reserve (Belgium and The Netherlands), a tidal lagoon that is included in the Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance and has been designated as Natura 2000 area, among others due to its function as wintering habitat for shorebirds that feed upon macrobenthic invertebrates. Species response models show highest biomass of these prey species in organically enriched cohesive sediments and a distinct decline in probability of occurrence for most species in coarse sediments. Further, the biomass of macrobenthos declined between 2003 and 2010 in the extensive low intertidal inlet channel concurrent with the coarsening of the sediment over time in this hydrodynamically stressed habitat. In contrast, macrobenthos biomass increased in a sheltered shallow intertidal habitat that acted as a catchment area for finer sediments, therefore facilitating the succession towards a higher elevated habitat with salt marsh vegetation establishment. Hence, spatio-temporal sediment dynamics decreased site quality for intertidal predators due to a reduction in feeding areas over time, and a change in physical sediment properties that alter the macrobenthos species occurrence and population biomass. This study thus illustrates that sediment transport dynamics may affect the functioning of coastal shallow soft-sediment habitats, like coastal lagoons. The presented macrobenthos species response models provide a tool to assist in management actions that enable the conservation of cohesive low intertidal habitats that provide a high food supply to shorebirds, fish and macrocrustaceans.},

  abstract = {For decades, studies of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have challenged traditional concepts in toxicology, in particular the dogma of “the dose makes the poison,” because EDCs can have effects at low doses that are not predicted by effects at higher doses. Here, we review two major concepts in EDC studies: low dose and nonmonotonicity. Low-dose effects were defined by the National Toxicology Program as those that occur in the range of human exposures or effects observed at doses below those used for traditional toxicological studies. We review the mechanistic data for low-dose effects and use a weight-of-evidence approach to analyze five examples from the EDC literature. Additionally, we explore nonmonotonic dose-response curves, defined as a nonlinear relationship between dose and effect where the slope of the curve changes sign somewhere within the range of doses examined. We provide a detailed discussion of the mechanisms responsible for generating these phenomena, plus hundreds of examples from the cell culture, animal, and epidemiology literature. We illustrate that nonmonotonic responses and low-dose effects are remarkably common in studies of natural hormones and EDCs. Whether low doses of EDCs influence certain human disorders is no longer conjecture, because epidemiological studies show that environmental exposures to EDCs are associated with human diseases and disabilities. We conclude that when nonmonotonic dose-response curves occur, the effects of low doses cannot be predicted by the effects observed at high doses. Thus, fundamental changes in chemical testing and safety determination are needed to protect human health.},

For years, risk assessment agencies have relied on the toxicological principle that “the dose makes the poison” and that effects scale linearly with dose. Yet, there are numerous examples from vitamins, essential nutrients, hormones, and environmental chemicals that defy this simplistic expectation. Nonmonotonic dose responses have been reported in hundreds of studies of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and further evaluations have revealed a number of mechanisms responsible for these curves. This article reviews evidence supporting the existence of nonmonotonic dose responses and discusses why these have continued to generate controversy.

One such attribute is the ability of EDCs to induce nonmonotonic dose response curves, where low and high doses can produce opposite effects. Another is that EDCs can disrupt hormone-sensitive outcomes, even when exposures are very low, e.g., administered in levels as low as nanogram or microgram per kilogram in experimental animals, or the low doses that humans encounter in their everyday lives. This chapter describes the mechanisms by which low dose effects and nonmonotonic responses can manifest and some specific examples from the EDC literature. It also describes the recent debate over whether these effects are “real,” and whether they are common enough to influence chemical safety assessments for EDCs. Together, these features of EDCs suggest that the methods used to determine safe doses for human exposures are flawed.},

  abstract = {The primary aim of this study was to select a set of relevant biomarkers in feral eel for the biological assessment of inland water pollution. A suite of biochemical parameters in eel (hepatic biotransformation enzymes and cofactors, antioxidant enzymes, PAH metabolites, DNA adducts, serum transaminases) was measured in order to determine their response to xenobiotic compounds in the environment. The results of the analyses of organic trace pollutants in sediments and eel from six Amsterdam freshwater sites with different pollution levels have been discussed in the first part of this paper (Van der Oost, R., Opperhuizen, A., Satumalay, K., Heida, H. and Vermeulen, N.P.E., 1996a. Biomonitoring aquatic pollution with feral eel (Anguilla anguilla): I. Bioaccumulation: biota-sediment ratios of PCBs, OCPs, PCDDs and PCDFs. Aquat. Toxicol., 35: 21–46). The main conclusions drawn from the trends found for the levels and activities of biochemical parameters in eel were the following: the phase I biotransformation enzymes in eel liver appeared to be the most sensitive to environmental xenobiotics. Cytochrome b5 (Cyt b5), cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A), ethoxyresurofin-O-deethylase (EROD) and EROD turnover (EROD/P450) in eel liver showed significant responses to contamination, and can therefore be used as biomarkers. Levels of a CYP3A-like protein were significantly elevated in eel from three moderately polluted sites, but since this protein was not induced in eel from the most polluted site its relevance as a biomarker remains unclear. Phase II enzymes and cofactors in eel liver were less susceptible to pollutants than phase I enzymes. The activity of UDP glucuronyl transferase (UDPGT) in eel may, however, be a useful biomarker, while glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were less sensitive. The reduced glutathione (GSH) cofactor levels in eel liver are most probably not reliable as biomarkers. Hepatic activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and GSH-peroxidase (GPOX)) in eel did not show any response to pollution and are therefore not feasible as biomarkers. The level of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OH pyrene) in eel bile might be a useful biomarker to determine short-term PAH exposure. The hepatic level of DNA adducts in eel liver seems to be a sensitive biomarker for exposure to (and possible effects of) mutagenic and carcinogenic xenobiotics. In feral eel, serum transaminases are not usable as biomarkers of chronic intoxication. The proposed set of the most relevant biomarkers for the assessment of inland water pollution with feral eel thus consists of the following six parameters: cyt b5, CYP1A, EROD, EROD/P450, UDPGT and DNA adducts.},

  abstract = {A technique is described for the determination of organic carbon and nitrogen in small samples (5 mg) of marine sediments that optimizes the analytical capabilities of the Carlo Erba NA-1500 Elemental Analyzer. This instrument analyses total carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in solid samples by flash combustion. Organic and inorganic forms of carbon are differentiated by sample manipulation prior to analysis without loss of nitrogen. Organic carbon is determined after removing carbonate carbon by acidification with sulfurous acid in situ within aluminum sample cups, thus eliminating loss of acid-soluble organic carbon during carbonate dissolution, or the necessity of determining organic carbon by “difference-on-combustion”. Excess acid is volatized as SO2 and H2O upon drying, eliminating the dual problems of retention of waters-of-hydration of calcium salts and “excess” acid. The procedure provides rapid and rouitine analyses of marine sediments, yielding a relative precision of ±0.3\% of the measured value for organic carbon and ±1.6\% for nitrogen, and blank levels 0.31 ± 0.085 μg-carbon and 0 μg-nitrogen. Conservatively estimated absolute and relative detection limits are 0.62 μg-carbon (2 times mean blank value) and 0.01\% carbon, respectively.},

  abstract = {Mysids (Crustacea: Mysidacea) are used routinely in acute toxicity testing to evaluate the comparative toxicity of chemicals to aquatic organisms. The need for sublethal endpoints that provide comprehensive understanding of the potential impacts of toxicants to natural populations has resulted in examination of several physiological responses in mysid shrimp, including scope for growth (SFG) and cellular energy allocation (CEA). Both assays, based on the concept that energy in excess of that required for normal maintenance will be available for growth and reproduction, have been reported independently for the mysid Neomysis integer. The present study compares the responses of N. integer following exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations of the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos using both assays. Oxygen consumption in the SFG assay was significantly correlated with cellular respiration rate in the CEA assay, and both were significantly increased by chlorpyrifos exposure. In addition, the protein, sugar, lipid and total energy content in the CEA assay and the egestion rate in the SFG assay were significantly different in chlorpyrifos-exposed mysids compared with control mysids. In contrast, absorption efficiency in the SFG assay was unaffected by pesticide exposure. Significant effects in the SFG and CEA assays were more pronounced following short (i.e. 48 h) compared with longer exposure periods (e.g. 168 h). SFG was significantly reduced at near-lethal concentrations (0.072 and 0.100 μg chlorpyrifos l−1), whereas CEA was reduced in all chlorpyrifos-exposed mysids (0.038, 0.056, 0.072 and 0.100 μg chlorpyrifos l−1) although there was no concentration response.},

Our results demonstrate that the factors studied have main and interaction effects not only on the copper level, but also on the ratios between the cytosolic Cu and Cu bound to thioneins, probably resulting in different degrees of toxicity. In addition, it has been shown that the calcium levels are affected by simultaneous variations of the experimental factors. In particular the gills of mussels exposed to Cu2+ exhibit a significant increase in calcium concentration, thus indicating that copper may alter Ca2+ homeostasis.},

  abstract = {Shallow lakes provide essential ecological and environmental services but are exposed to multiple stressors, including agricultural runoff (ARO) and climate warming, which may act on different target receptors disrupting their normal functioning. We performed a microcosm experiment to determine the individual and combined effects of three stressors—pesticides, nitrate and climate warming—on two trophic levels representative of communities found in shallow lakes. We used three submerged macrophyte species (Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton perfoliatus, Elodea nuttallii), eight benthic or pelagic microalgal species and three primary consumer species (Daphnia magna, Lymnaea stagnalis, Dreissena polymorpha) with different feeding preferences for benthic and pelagic primary producers. Eight different treatments consisted of a control, only nitrate, a pesticide cocktail, and a combination of nitrate and pesticides representing ARO, each replicated at ambient temperature and +3.5°C, mimicking climate warming. Pesticides negatively affected all functional groups except phytoplankton, which increased. Warming and nitrate modified these effects. Strong but opposite pesticide and warming effects on Myriophyllum drove the response of the total macrophyte biomass. Nitrate significantly suppressed Myriophyllum final biomass, but not overall macrophyte and microalgal biomass. Nitrate and pesticides in combination caused a macrophyte decline, and the system tipped towards phytoplankton dominance. Strong synergistic or even reversed stressor interaction effects were observed for macrophytes or periphyton. We emphasize the need for more complex community- and ecosystem-level studies incorporating multiple stressor scenarios to define safe operating spaces.},

  abstract = {Since the beginning of this century, trichloroacetic acid solutions of various concentrations have been used for chemical exfoliation. These solutions have been prepared by using four different formulas. To prepare a 50\% solution, for instance, water may be added to 50 g of trichloroacetic acid crystals until 100 ml of solution is obtained (weight-to-volume solution). Alternatively, 50 g of water may be added to 50 g of trichloroacetic acid crystals (weight-to-weight solution), or 50 g of trichloroacetic acid crystals may be solved in 100 ml of water (weight-plus-volume solution). Finally, a saturated trichloroacetic acid solution (or “100\% solution”) may be diluted by an equal volume of water (dilution). Depending on the method used, these so-called 50\% solutions contain 40 to 71 weight-to-volume percentages of trichloroacetic acid.         From a review of 120 publications on trichloroacetic acid peeling that have appeared since 1926, it was concluded that the authors of 87 of these publications (73 percent) did not report their formula for the trichloroacetic acid solution. Any one of the four methods was reported to have been used by the 33 authors who did report their formula. Eight of 10 internationally reputed pharmacopeias were found not to include the formula of a trichloroacetic acid solution.         Proper evaluation of results and prevention of complications of trichloroacetic acid chemexfoliation is only feasible if both the concentration and the formula of trichloroacetic acid solution are reported by the author. Practitioners who use a trichloroacetic acid solution need to establish that the concentration of the solution they apply corresponds with that of the solution reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Delineating the routes of metal uptake in marine invertebrates is important for understanding metal bioaccumulation and toxicity and for setting appropriate water and sediment quality criteria. Trace element biogeochemical cycling can also be affected if the rates of metal uptake and regeneration by marine animals are dependent on the routes of metal accumulation. In this paper we review recent studies on the pathways of metal accumulation in marine invertebrates. Both food and water can dominate metal accumulation, depending on the species, metal and food sources. Trace elements which exist in seawater primarily in anionic forms (e.g. As and Se) are mainly accumulated from food. For metals that tend to associate with protein, uptake from water can be an important source. Kinetic modeling has recently been used to quantitatively separate the pathways of metal uptake in a few marine invertebrates. This approach requires measurements of several physiological parameters, including metal assimilation efficiencies (AE) from ingested food, metal uptake rates from the dissolved phase, and metal efflux rates (physiological turnover rates) in animals. For suspension feeders such as mussels and copepods, uptake from the dissolved phase and food ingestion can be equally important to metal accumulation. Metal AE and partition coefficients for suspended particles, which are dependent on many environmental conditions, can critically affect the exposure pathways of metals. For marine surface deposit feeding polychaetes such as Nereis succinea, nearly all metals are obtained from ingestion of sediments, largely because of their high ingestion rates and low uptake from solution. The bioavailability of metals from food and the trophic transfer of metals must be considered in establishing water and sediment quality.},

In several major groups of marine animals such as predators and deposit-feeding animals, diet (food) is the predominant source for metal accumulation. The importance of trophic transfer raises very fundamental questions about its toxicity to aquatic animals and in setting water quality standards which go beyond waterborne metal exposure. Ten years of research on the dietary toxicity of metals in several groups of aquatic animals, including zooplankton and fish, is reviewed. It is suggested the future studies should attempt to incorporate the dosage rate or the dietary influx rate in the design of toxicology experiments to facilitate inter-comparison of the results of different studies.},

  abstract = {Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a crucial antioxidant enzyme playing the first defense line in antioxidant pathways against reactive oxygen species in various organisms including marine invertebrates. There exist mainly two specific forms, Cu/Zn-SOD (SOD1) and Mn-SOD (SOD2), in eukaryotes. SODs are known to be concurrently modulated by a variety of environmental stressors. By using central composite experimental design and response surface method, the joint effects of water temperature (18–34°C) and copper ion concentration (0.1–1.5 mg/L) on the total SOD activity in the digestive gland of Crassostrea ariakensis were studied. The results showed that the linear effect of temperature was highly significant (P{$<$}0.01), the quadratic effect of temperature was significant (P{$<$}0.05); the linear effect of copper ion concentration was not significant (P{$>$}0.05), while the quadratic effect of copper ion concentration was highly significant (P{$<$}0.01); the interactive effect of temperature and copper ion concentration was not significant (P{$>$}0.05); the effect of temperature was greater than that of copper ion concentration. The model equation of digestive gland SOD enzyme activity towards the two factors of interest was established, with R2 and predictive R2 as high as 0.961 6 and 0.820 7, respectively, suggesting that the goodness-offit to experimental data be very satisfactory, and could be applied to prediction of digestive gland SOD activity in C. ariakensis under the conditions of the experiment. Our results would be conducive to addressing the health of aquatic animals and/or to detecting environmental problems by taking SOD as a potential bioindicator.},

  abstract = {Distribution coefficients (Kd) were used to estimate the most important geochemical phases within the suspended particulate matter (SPM) pool for sorption of Cd, Cu and Zn. Given that pH effects were expected to be minimal, as the don is a well buffered system, the possible influence of secondary environmental variables [temperature, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved Ca2+ and NaC] on trace metal partitioning between SPM and the dissolved phase was evaluated using a series of multiple linear regressions for total (KdT) as well as the phase specific KdL leachable phase; KdR reducible phase; and KdO oxidizable phase) distribution coefficient estimates. The three metals varied in their sorptions patterns. Cd and Zn showed the same relative affinities for three SPM pools (leachable = reducible {$>$} oxidizable), while Cu affinities ranked oxidizable = leachable {$>$} reducible. Secondary environmental factors were identified as more important influences on trace metal partitioning than pH. Temperature and NaCl (from road salt runoff) were found to be key environmental variables influencing trace metal partitioning. A decrease in water temperature caused decreases in the accumulation of Cd, Cu and Zn in the particulate pool. Increasing NaCl concentrations decreased the concentrations of Cd and Zn associated with the particulate leachable phase and the Cd, Zn and Cu content in the oxidizable SPM phase. These results suggest that in running waters during winter months, or even during summer months in the hypolimnia of sufficiently deep lakes, a relatively higher proportion of these metals remains in the dissolved and potentially more bioavailable pool.},

Sequential extraction confirmed that much more labile copper (in actual and percentage terms) was present as spiked concentrations increased, although the residual fractions contained similar amounts across concentrations. This is also reflected in the tissue concentration of the worms which increased in line with the sediment concentrations. Adult mortality was not dependent on the exposure time, but higher concentrations usually induced greater mortality for both sexes. Oocytes were significantly smaller at higher concentrations although pairwise comparisons did not show specific differences. Spawning of males occurred a number of days earlier in the higher concentrations. Differences in the number of embryos developing normally after in vitro fertilizations of oocytes fertilized with sperm from exposed males and non-exposed males showed that sperm were more susceptible to toxicity, but oocytes were also affected at the highest concentration. These results show that there are direct and indirect reproductive consequences of parental exposure to copper with implications for recruitment and subsequent colonization of polluted sediments for this ecologically and commercially important species.},

  abstract = {Copper and zinc are metals that have been traditionally thought of as past contamination legacies. However, their industrial use is still extensive and current applications (e.g. nanoparticles and antifouling paints) have become additional marine environment delivery routes. Determining a pollutant's genotoxicity is an ecotoxicological priority, but in marine benthic systems putative substances responsible for sediment genotoxicity have rarely been identified. Studies that use sediment as the delivery matrix combined with exposures over life-history relevant timescales are also missing for metals. Here we assess copper and zinc's genotoxicity by exposing the ecologically important polychaete Alitta virens to sediment spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations for 9 months. Target bioavailable sediment and subsequent porewater concentrations reflect the global contamination range for coasts, whilst tissue concentrations, although elevated, were comparable with other polychaetes. Survival generally reduced as concentrations increased, but monthly analyses show that growth was not significantly different between treatments. The differential treatment mortality may have enabled the surviving worms in the high concentration treatments to capture more food thus removing any concentration treatment effects for biomass. Using the alkaline comet assay we confirm that both metals via the sediment are genotoxic at concentrations routinely found in coastal regions and this is supported by elevated DNA damage in worms from field sites. However, combined with the growth data it also highlights the tolerance of A.~virens to DNA damage. Finally, using long term (decadal) monitoring data we show stable or increasing sediment concentrations of these metals for many areas. This will potentially mean coastal sediment is a significant mutagenic hazard to the benthic community for decades to come. An urgent reappraisal of the current input sources for these ‘old pollutants’ is, therefore, required.},

  abstract = {The Strait of Georgia (SoG) is a semi-enclosed, urban basin with seasonally dependent estuarine water circulation, dominantly influenced by Northeast Pacific waters and the Fraser River. To establish a baseline and understand the fate and potential toxicity of Cu in the SoG, we determined seasonal and spatial depth profiles of dissolved Cu (dCu) speciation, leading to estimates of the free hydrated copper (Cu2+) concentrations, as a proxy for Cu toxicity. The concentration of dCu was largely controlled by conservative mixing of the ocean and freshwater endmembers in the SoG. In all samples, ligand concentrations exceeded dCu, by a ratio greater than 1.5, resulting in the complexation of 99.98\% of the dCu by strong binding organic ligands. The concentrations of Cu2+ were less than 10-13.2 M, significantly lower than the well-established Cu toxicity threshold (10-12 M Cu2+) for microorganisms. Our results indicate that ambient Cu-binding ligands effectively buffer Cu2+ concentrations within the Strait of Georgia, posing no threat to marine life. In almost 90\% of the samples, the ligands were best classified as a single ligand class, with a logKCuL,Cu2+cond between 12.5 and 14.1. The concentrations of these single class ligands were greatest in warm, low salinity, nutrient depleted waters, suggesting that either terrestrially sourced ligands dominate dCu speciation in the SoG, or freshwater sources in the SoG establish the conditions that promote the production of Cu binding ligands in its surface waters. The remaining 10\% of the samples were from the euphotic zone, where we detected a stronger ligand class, L1, of logKCuL1,Cu2+cond between 13.5 and 14.3, and a weaker ligand class, L2, of logKCuL2,Cu2+cond between 11.5 and 12.3. In these surface samples, logKCuL1,Cu2+cond and logKCuL2,Cu2+cond were positively correlated with temperature, while L2 concentrations were positively correlated with chromophoric dissolved organic matter of terrestrial origin. This study is the first to perform hierarchal clustering of a trace metal speciation dataset and enabled the distinction of 6 clusters across season, depth, and region of the SoG, highlighting the influence of freshwater and open ocean ligand sources, conservative mixing dynamics, and particulate Cu concentrations on dCu speciation within estuarine basins.},

  abstract = {Often ingredients of personal care products are present in treated wastewaters, e. g grey water (GW), and are discharged into aquatic systems. Conventional treatment of GW does not fully eliminate micropollutants such as the UV filter substance 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid (PBSA). Photolysis has been proposed as an alternative treatment method for other micropollutants, but it is not clear yet whether it can also be used to eliminate PBSA. One goal of this study was to better understand the basic pathways involved in this process. It aimed to identify photo-transformation products (PTPs) by using, in the test conditions, an initial concentration of PBSA higher than those expected in the environment. The photolysis experiments were carried out using Xenon and UV lamps. Under Xenon irradiation only slight primary elimination was found. UV irradiation resulted in almost complete primary elimination of PBSA but not in full mineralization. Four isomeric mono-hydroxylated PTPs were identified by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) which could be confirmed by other studies. A modified luminescent bacteria test (LBT) with Vibrio fischeri was employed to assess acute and chronic toxic effects of the irradiated photolytic mixtures. A strong correlation was found between the kinetics of two of the PTPs and luminescence inhibition indicating bacterial toxicity. Using a set of in silico quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, this study also offered new insights concerning the environmental fate and toxicity of the TPs of PBSA as the TPs generated by UV-treatment are more persistent and partly more toxic than PBSA.},

  abstract = {The concentrations of dissolved copper (Cud), copper-binding ligands, thiourea-type thiols, and humic substances (HSCu) were measured in estuarine waters adjacent to Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA, on a monthly basis from April to December 2014. Here we present the seasonal cycle of copper speciation within the estuary and compare it to the development of an annually occurring bloom of Ammonia Oxidizing Archaea (AOA), which require copper for many enzymes. Two types of complexing ligands (L1 and L2) were found to dominate with mean complex stabilities (log KCuL′) of 14.5 and 12.8. Strong complexation resulted in lowering the concentration of free cupric ion (Cu2+) to femtomolar (fM) levels throughout the study and to sub-fM levels during the summer months. A Thaumarchaeota bloom during this period suggests that this organism manages to grow at very low Cu2+ concentrations. Correlation of the concentration of the L1 ligand class with a thiourea-type thiol and the L2 ligand class with HSCu provide an interesting dimension to the identity of the ligand classes. Due to the stronger complex stability, 82–99\% of the copper was bound to L1. Thiourea-type thiols typically form Cu(I) species, which would suggest that up to \textasciitilde 90\% copper could be present as Cu(I) in this region. In view of the very low concentration of free copper (pCu {$>$} 15 at the onset and during the bloom) and a reputedly high requirement for copper, it is likely that the Thaumarchaeota are able to access thiol-bound copper directly.},

  abstract = {Benthic macrofauna are a key component of intertidal ecosystems. Their mobility and behavior determine processes like nutrient cycling and the biogeomorphic development of intertidal flats. Many physical drivers of benthic macrofauna behavior, such as sediment grain size, have been well-studied. However, little is known about how sediment bulk density (a measure of sediment compaction and water content) affects this behavior. We investigated the effect of bulk density on the burrowing rate, burrowing depth, bioturbation activity, and oxygen consumption of bivalves (Limecola balthica, Scrobicularia plana, and Cerastoderma edule) and polychaetes (Hediste diversicolor and Arenicola marina) during a 29-day mesocosm experiment. We compared four sediment treatments consisting of two sediments of differing grain size classes (sandy and muddy) with two bulk densities (compact and soft). Overall, bulk density had a strong effect on benthic macrofauna behavior. Benthic macrofauna burrowed faster and bioturbation more intensely in soft sediments with low bulk density, regardless of grain size. In addition, L. balthica burrowed deeper in low bulk density sediment. Finally, we found that larger bivalves (both C. edule and S. plana) burrowed slower in compact sediment than smaller ones. This study shows that benthic macrofauna change their behavior in subtle but important ways under different sediment bulk densities which could affect animal-sediment interactions and tidal flat biogeomorphology. We conclude that lower bulk density conditions lead to more active macrofaunal movement and sediment reworking.},

  abstract = {BioTransformer 3.0 (https://biotransformer.ca) is a freely available web server that supports accurate, rapid and comprehensive in silico metabolism prediction. It combines machine learning approaches with a rule-based system to predict small-molecule metabolism in human tissues, the human gut as well as the external environment (soil and water microbiota). Simply stated, BioTransformer takes a molecular structure as input (SMILES or SDF) and outputs an interactively sortable table of the predicted metabolites or transformation products (SMILES, PNG images) along with the enzymes that are predicted to be responsible for those reactions and richly annotated downloadable files (CSV and JSON). The entire process typically takes less than a minute. Previous versions of BioTransformer focused exclusively on predicting the metabolism of xenobiotics (such as plant natural products, drugs, cosmetics and other synthetic compounds) using a limited number of pre-defined steps and somewhat limited rule-based methods. BioTransformer 3.0 uses much more sophisticated methods and incorporates new databases, new constraints and new prediction modules to not only more accurately predict the metabolic transformation products of exogenous xenobiotics but also the transformation products of endogenous metabolites, such as amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, organic acids, and lipids. BioTransformer 3.0 can also support customized sequential combinations of these transformations along with multiple iterations to simulate multi-step human biotransformation events. Performance tests indicate that BioTransformer 3.0 is 40–50\% more accurate, far less prone to combinatorial ‘explosions’ and much more comprehensive in terms of metabolite coverage/capabilities than previous versions of BioTransformer.},

  abstract = {Lipidomic profiling of plasma is an emerging field, given the importance of lipids in major cellular pathways, and is dependent on efficient lipid extraction protocols. Recent attention has turned to plasma lipidomics as a means to identify potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers related to dementia, neuropsychiatric health and disease. Although several solvent-based lipid extraction protocols have been developed and are currently in use, novel and more efficient methods could greatly simplify lipid analysis in plasma and warrant investigation. Human plasma from normolipidemic adult volunteers was collected to evaluate three different solvent extraction protocols, including the classical Folch method, the methanol/tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) (Matyash) method, and a recent single-phase methanol/1-butanol (Alshehry) method. Extracted lipids were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in positive and negative ion mode. Overall, more than 500 different lipids were identified in positive and negative ion mode combined. Our data show that the single phase Alshehry method was as effective as the Folch and Matyash methods in extracting most lipid classes and was more effective in extraction of polar lipids. Normalized peak areas of the Alshehry method were highly and positively correlated with both the Folch and Matyash methods (r2 = 0.99 and 0.97, respectively). Within- and between- subject correlations were r = 0.99 and 0.96, respectively. Median intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV\%) in positive mode was 14.1, 15.1, and 21.8 for the Alshehry, Folch and Matyash methods, respectively. Median Alshehry inter-assay CV (collected over 5 separate days) was 14.4\%. In conclusion, the novel Alshehry method was at least as good as, if not better than the established biphasic extraction methods in detecting a wide range of lipid classes, using as little as 10 μL of plasma, and was highly reproducible, safer and more environmentally-friendly as it doesn't require chloroform.},

  abstract = {ZnO nanoparticles (nZnO) are released into the coastal environment from multiple sources, yet their toxicity to marine organisms is not well understood. We investigated the interactive effects of salinity (normal 15, low 5, and fluctuating 5–15) and nZnO (100~μg~l−1) on innate immunity of the blue mussels Mytilus edulis from a brackish area of the Baltic Sea. Exposure to ionic Zn (100~μg~l−1) was used to test whether the toxic effects of nZnO can be attributed to the potential release of Zn2+. Functional parameters and the expression of key immune-related genes were investigated in the mussels exposed to nZnO or ionic Zn under different salinity regimes for 21~days. nZnO exposures elevated hemocyte mortality, suppressed adhesion, stimulated phagocytosis, and led to an apparent increase in lysosomal volume. At salinity 15, nZnO suppressed the mRNA expression of the Toll-like receptors TLRb and c, C-lectin, and the complement system component C3q indicating impaired ability for pathogen recognition. In contrast, the mRNA levels of an antimicrobial peptide defensin increased during nZnO exposure at salinity 15. At fluctuating salinity (5–15), nZnO exposure increased expression of multiple immune-related genes in hemocytes including the complement system components C1 and C3q, and the Toll-like receptors TLRa, b and c. Low salinity (5) had strong immunosuppressive effects on the functional and molecular immune traits of M. edulis that overshadowed the effects of nZnO. The salinity-dependent modulation of immune response to nZnO cannot be attributed to the differences in the aggregation or solubility of nZnO, and likely reflects the interaction of the toxic effects of nanoparticles and physiological effects of the osmotic stress. These findings have implications for the environmental risk assessment of nanomaterials and the development of the context-specific biomarker baselines for coastal pollution monitoring.},

  abstract = {Sediment contamination is widespread and can be toxic to aquatic ecosystems and impair human health. Despite their significant ecological function, meio- and microbiota in aquatic ecosystems have been poorly studied in conventional sediment ecotoxicity tests because of the difficulty in sample collecting and identification. In the present study, a novel DNA metabarcoding method was used to assess the effects of spiked copper (Cu) on benthic eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities in laboratory sediment toxicity tests with macroinvertebrates, the chironomid Chironomus tepperi and the amphipod Austrochiltonia subtenuis. In addition to the obvious toxic effects to experimental animals, microbiota (bacteria, protists, algae, and fungi) were significantly altered by spiked Cu in the sediments. The phylogenetic diversity of eukaryotic communities was decreased after spiked-Cu exposure. Even a low–spiked Cu treatment (125 mg/kg) altered structures of eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities in the amphipod experiment. The present study demonstrates that measuring microbiota communities will expand our understanding of the influences of contaminants on aquatic ecosystems. Particularly, the alterations of phylogenetic biodiversity of eukaryotic communities and the structure of sedimentary communities are sensitive indicators for sediment contamination, which can be incorporated in the monitoring and assessment of sediment quality.

Inflammation is considered to be a major cause of most chronic diseases, especially in more than 100 types of inflammatory diseases which include Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis, Crohn's disease, colitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and Parkinson's disease. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on inflammatory diseases. TBK1 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase which regulates antiviral defense, host-virus interaction, and immunity. It is ubiquitously expressed in mouse stomach, colon, thymus, and liver. Interestingly, high levels of active TBK1 have also been found to be associated with inflammatory diseases, indicating that TBK1 is closely related to inflammatory responses. Even though relatively few studies have addressed the functional roles of TBK1 relating to inflammation, this paper discusses some recent findings that support the critical role of TBK1 in inflammatory diseases and underlie the necessity of trials to develop useful remedies or therapeutics that target TBK1 for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.},

They have varying phenotypes and clinical diseases, depending on the underlying genetic mutations. Some ensue from direct changes in the gene that encodes the ATP7A protein. The severity of the mutations can affect the phenotype expressed. If the mutations are severe loss-of-function mutations, the result is a lethal neurodevelopmental and systemic disease with low copper and reduced cuproenzymes activity (Menkes disease). If the mutations are milder, such as with leaky splice junction defects, some copper transport is possible and the phenotype is less severe, as in occipital horn syndrome. Two unique missense mutations that do not impair the copper transport function of ATP7A but rather its trafficking, cause a motor neuron-specific illness that develops gradually, with no evidence of abnormal copper metabolism. ATP7A function can also be affected by mutations outside of its coding gene, such as in MEDNIK and Huppke–Brendel syndromes. The resulting defects in intracellular localization of the ATP7A (and ATP7B) pump(s) can impair normal copper transport function.},

Inactivation of these important biological events may result in genomic instability and cell transformation, as well as alterations of therapeutic sensitivity. Gadd45a, a p53- and BRCA1-regulated stress-inducible gene, has been characterized as one of the important players that participate in cellular response to a variety of DNA damage agents. Interestingly, the signaling machinery that regulates Gadd45a induction by genotoxic stress involves both p53-dependent and -independent pathways; the later may employ BRCA1-related or MAP kinase-mediated signals. Gadd45a protein has been reported to interact with multiple important cellular proteins, including Cdc2 protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p21Waf1/Cip1 protein, core histone protein and MTK/MEKK4, an up-stream activator of the JNK/SAPK pathway, indicating that Gadd45a may play important roles in the control of cell cycle checkpoint, DNA repair process, and signaling transduction. The importance of Gadd45a in maintaining genomic integrity is well manifested by the demonstration that disruption of endogenous Gadd45a in mice results in genomic instability and increased carcinogenesis. Therefore, Gadd45a appears to be an important component in the cellular defense network that is required for maintenance of genomic stability.},

Factors influencing bioavailability of heavy metals in sediment have never been comprehensively considered and the sediment properties still fail to understand and even controversial. In this review, the mechanisms of sediment properties such as acid-volatile sulfides (AVS), organic matter, texture (clay, silt or sand) and geology, organism behaviors as well as those influencing the bioavailability of metals were analyzed. Under anoxic condition, AVS mainly reduce the solubility and toxicity of metals, while organic matters, Fe–Mn oxides, clay or silt can stabilize heavy metals in elevated oxidative–reductive potential (ORP). Other factors including the variation of pH, redox potential, aging as well as nutrition and the behavior of benthic organism in sediment also largely alter metals mobility and distribution. These factors are often inter-related, and various toxicity assessment methods used to evaluate the bioavailability of trace metals have been also discussed. Additionally, we expect that some novel synthetic materials like polysulfides, nano-materials, provide the substantial amendments for metals pollution in sediment.},

  abstract = {The comparative tolerance and accumulation of the trace metals zinc, copper and cadmium in populations of the littoral polychaete worm Nereis diversicolor from three sites: (a) heavily metal-contaminated Dulas Bay in Anglesey, north Wales, (b) the Blackwater estuary, Essex, as a control site, and (c) West Thurrock, the Thames estuary as a site of intermediate metal contamination, were investigated. Worms from Dulas Bay did not show increased tolerance to any metal, but worms from West Thurrock showed significantly increased copper sensitivity compared to the worms from Dulas Bay and the Blackwater. Worms accumulated zinc and copper from sediments with raised zinc and copper concentrations, and all three metals from solution in proportion to dissolved concentration. Accumulated metal was not excreted in 21 days and field concentrations of zinc and copper in the worms differed between sites. There was no evidence for inter-populational differences in accumulation rates of zinc and cadmium from solution, but worms from Dulas Bay accumulated copper from solution at a significantly higher rate than did worms from the other two sites. Nereis diversicolor takes up and accumulates zinc and cadmium from solution at similar rates per unit molar exposure, but cadmium is taken up at a greater rate per unit free metal ion molar exposure. Although N. diversicolor from Dulas Bay is exposed to very high availabilities of zinc and copper, accumulation and detoxification mechanisms are sufficient to cope with the extra metal influx (accentuated for dissolved copper) without selection for a metal-tolerant population.},

  abstract = {"This book, written by three behavioral scientists for other behavioral scientists, addresses common issues in statistical analysis for the behavioral and educational sciences. Modern Statistical \& Computing Methods for the Behavioral and Educational Sciences using R emphasizes the direct link between scientific research questions and data analysis. Purposeful attention is paid to the integration of design, statistical methodology, and computation to propose answers to specific research questions. Furthermore, practical suggestions for the analysis and presentation of results, in prose, tables and/or figures, are included. Optional sections for each chapter include methodological extensions for readers desiring additional technical details. Rather than focus on mathematical calculations like so many other introductory texts in the behavioral sciences, the authors focus on conceptual explanations and the use of statistical computing. Statistical computing is an integral part of statistical work, and to support student learning in this area, examples using the R computer program are provided throughout the book. Rather than relegate examples to the end of chapters, the authors interweave computer examples with the narrative of the book. Topical coverage includes an introduction to R, data exploration of one variable, data exploration of multivariate data - comparing two groups and many groups, permutation and randomization tests, the independent samples t-Test, the Bootstrap test, interval estimates and effect sizes, power, and dependent samples"--},
