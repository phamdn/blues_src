## Materials
-	1 mM NADPH: in 5 mL tube add 4.2 mg NADPH (M = 833.4) and 5 mL homogenization buffer. Store at 4째C.
-	10 mM GSSG: in 5 mL tube add 30.6 mg GSSG (M = 612.6) and 5 mL water. Store at 4째C.
-	1% BSA: in 5 mL tube add 50 mg BSA and 5 mL homogenization buffer. Store at 4째C.

## Methods

- Master mix for 24 rxn: in 5 mL tube add 3120 uL homogenization buffer, 520 uL NADPH, 520 uL GSSG, and 520 uL BSA (120:20:20:20). **Vortex**.
-	Rxn in duplicate wells: 
    + 180 uL master mix + 20 uL homogenization buffer for control
    + 180 uL master mix + 20 uL supernatant for sample
-	Measure kinetically at 340 nm in 15 min with 30s interval, at room temperature (25 째C), shake 5s before reading. Use 21/31 points for slope.
